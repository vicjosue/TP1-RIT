netgroup(5)           Linux Reference Manual          netgroup(5)



NAME
       netgroup - specify network groups

DESCRIPTION
       The  netgroup file  defines "netgroups", which are sets of
       (host, user, domain) tuples, used for permission  checking
       when doing remote mounts, remote logins and remote shells.

       Each line in the file consists of a netgroup name followed
       by  a  by  a  list  of  members,  where a member is either
       another netgroup name, or a triple:

              (host, user, domain)

       where the host, user, and domain are character strings for
       the  corresponding components. Any of the three fields can
       be empty, in which case it specifies a "wildcard", or  may
       consist of the string "-" to specify "no valid value". The
       domain field must either be the local domain name or empty
       for  the  netgroup  entry  to be used. This field does not
       limit the netgroup or provide security. The  domain  field
       refers to the domain in which the triple is valid, not the
       domain containing the the trusted host.

       A gateway machine should  be  listed  under  all  possible
       hostnames by which it may be recognized:

              gateway (server,,) (server-sn,,) (server-bb,,)


       The  getnetgrent  functions  should  normally  be  used to
       access the netgroup database.


FILES
       /etc/netgroup

WARNINGS
       The  triple  (,,domain)  allows  all  users  and  machines
       trusted  access,  and  has  the  same effect as the triple
       (,,). Use the host  and  user  fields  of  the  triple  to
       restrict  the  access  correctly to a specific set of mem­
       bers.

BUGS
       The Linux libc5 does  not  query  the  /etc/netgroup  file
       directly, it only querys the NIS server for the groups. So
       the netgroup database must be stored  in  the  form  of  a
       hashed  dbm  database just like the passwd(5) and group(5)
       databases.

       This manpage mentions getnetgrent(3), but  it  seems  that
       manpage  hasn't  been  written yet. Since getnetgrent() is
       part of GNU libc it might also be that it is documented in
       info format.
