NAME
       sane-snapscan  -  SANE  backend  for AGFA SnapScan flatbed
       scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-snapscan  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now  Easy)  backend  that  provides access to AGFA
       SnapScan flatbed scanners. At present, the following scan­
       ners  are  supported from this backend: AGFA SnapScan 300,
       310, 600, and 1236s, 1236u, 1212u,  e20,  e25,  e40,  e50,
       e60,  Vuego  310s,  Acer  300f, 310s, 610s, 610plus, Prisa
       620s, Prisa 620u, Prisa 620ut, Prisa  640u,  Prisa  640bu,
       Prisa 1240, Prisa 3300, Prisa 4300, Prisa 5300 and Guille­
       mot Maxi Scan A4 Deluxe (SCSI) (with varying success).



DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the spe­
       cial device name must be a generic SCSI device or  a  sym­
       link  to  such  a device.  Under Linux, such a device name
       could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge,  for  example.   See  sane-
       scsi(5) for details.

       For  USB  scanners the devicename must contain the keyword
       "usb", as in /dev/usbscanner  or  /dev/usb/scanner0.   For
       scanners that need a firmware upload before scanning add a
       line starting with "firmware" followed by the fully quali­
       fied path to your firmware file, e.g.

              firmware /path/to/my/firmware.bin

       For  further details read http://snapscan.sourceforge.net.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the snapscan.conf file is a list of device
       names  that  correspond to SnapScan scanners.  Empty lines
       and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.   See
       sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid device
       name.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/snapscan.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-snapscan.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-snapscan.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_SNAPSCAN
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 255
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
