ANACRONTAB(5)         Anacron Users' Manual         ANACRONTAB(5)



NAME
       /etc/anacrontab - configuration file for anacron

DESCRIPTION
       The  file /etc/anacrontab describes the jobs controlled by
       anacron(8).  Its  lines  can  be  of  three  kinds:   job-
       description   lines,  environment  assignments,  or  empty
       lines.

       Job-description lines are of the form:

          period  delay  job-identifier  command

       The period is specified in days,  the  delay  in  minutes.
       The  job-identifier  can  contain any non-blank character,
       except slashes.  It is used to identify the job in Anacron
       messages,  and  as  the name for the job's timestamp file.
       The command can be any shell command.

       Environment assignment lines are of the form:

          VAR = VALUE

       Spaces around VAR are removed.  No spaces around VALUE are
       allowed  (unless  you  want them to be part of the value).
       The assignment takes effect from the next line to the  end
       of  the  file, or to the next assignment of the same vari­
       able.

       Empty lines are either blank lines, line containing white-
       space  only,  or  lines with white-space followed by a '#'
       followed by an arbitrary comment.
