NAME
       sane-scsi - SCSI adapter tips for scanners

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  contains various operating-system spe­
       cific tips and tricks on how to get scanners with  a  SCSI
       interface working.

GENERAL INFO
       For scanners with a SCSI interface, it may be necessary to
       edit the appropriate  backend  configuration  file  before
       using SANE for the first time.  For most systems, the con­
       figuration file should list the name of the  generic  SCSI
       device  that  the  scanner  is  connected  to (e.g., under
       Linux,  /dev/sg4  or  /dev/sge  is  such  a  generic  SCSI
       device).   It  is  customary  to  create  a  symlink  from
       /dev/scanner to the generic SCSI device that  the  scanner
       is  connected  to.   In  this case, the configuration file
       simply  lists  the  line  /dev/scanner.   For  a  detailed
       description  of  each backend's configuration file, please
       refer  to  the  relevant  backend   manual   page   (e.g.,
       sane-epson(5)  for Epson scanners, sane-hp(5) for HP scan­
       ners, etc.).

       For Linux, there is an alternate way of specifying scanner
       devices.   This  alternate way is based on /proc/scsi/scsi
       and allows to identify scanners by  the  SCSI  vendor  and
       model string and/or by the SCSI device address (consisting
       of bus number, channel number, id, and logical  unit  num­
       ber).  The syntax for specifying a scanner in this way is:

              scsi VENDOR MODEL TYPE BUS CHANNEL ID LUN

       where VENDOR is the SCSI vendor string, MODEL is the  SCSI
       model string, TYPE is type SCSI device type string, BUS is
       the SCSI bus number  (named  "host"  in  /proc/scsi/scsi),
       CHANNEL is the SCSI channel number, ID is the SCSI id, and
       LUN is the logical unit number of the scanner device.  The
       first  two  fields  are  strings which must be enclosed in
       double-quotes if they contain any whitespace.  The remain­
       ing  four  fields  are  non-negative integer numbers.  The
       correct values for these fields can be found by looking at
       the  output of the command "cat /proc/scsi/scsi".  To sim­
       plify configuration, a field's value can be replaced  with
       an  asterisk  symbol  (``*'').  An asterisk has the effect
       that any value is allowed for that particular field.  This
       can have the effect that a single scsi-line matches multi­
       ple devices.  When this happens, each matching device will
       be  probed by the backend one by one and registered if the
       backend thinks it is a compatible  device.   For  example,
       the line

              scsi MUSTEK MFS-06000CX Scanner 0 00 03 00

       would  attach  the  Mustek SCSI scanner with the following
       /proc/scsi/scsi entry:

         Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 03 Lun: 00
           Vendor: MUSTEK   Model: MFS-06000CX Rev: 4.04
           Type:   Scanner  ANSI SCSI revision: 0

       Usually it's sufficient to use vendor  and  model  strings
       only or even only the vendor string. The following example

              scsi MUSTEK * * * * * *

       would have the effect that all SCSI devices in the  system
       with  a vendor string of MUSTEK would be probed and recog­
       nized by the backend.

       If the remainder of a scsi-string  consists  of  asterisks
       only, the asterisks can be omitted.  For example, the fol­
       lowing line is equivalent to the one specified previously:

              scsi MUSTEK

       On some platforms (e.g., OpenStep), SANE device names take
       a special form.  This is explained below in  the  relevant
       platform-specific section.

       When  using a SCSI scanner, ensure that the access permis­
       sion for the generic SCSI device is set appropriately.  We
       recommend  to  add  a  group "scanner" to /etc/group which
       contains all users that should have access to the scanner.
       The  permission  of the device should then be set to allow
       group read and write access.  For example, if the  scanner
       is at generic SCSI device /dev/sge, then the following two
       commands would set the permission correctly:

              $ chgrp scanner /dev/sge
              $ chmod 660 /dev/sge

       When your system uses the device filesystem  (devfs),  you
       have  to  edit  /etc/devfs/perms.  There you should search
       the line

              REGISTER ^sg[^/]* PERMISSIONS root.root 0600

       and add a new line (eg. for changing permissions of sg4):

              REGISTER ^sg4 PERMISSIONS root.scanner 0660

              Adaptec 1522
                     The  scanner  probes  ok  but any attempt to
                     access it hangs the entire system. It  looks
                     like  something  is disabling interrupts and
                     then not reenabling them, so it looks like a
                     bug in the FreeBSD aic driver.

              Adaptec 1505
                     Works  on  FreeBSD  2.2.5R and 3.0 using the
                     aic driver, provided that Plug-and-Play sup­
                     port  is disabled on the card.  If there are
                     no uk devices, just do a ``sh MAKEDEV  uk0''
                     in  the  /dev  directory. The scanner should
                     then be accessible as  /dev/uk0  if  it  was
                     probed during boot.

LINUX
       First, make sure your  kernel  has  SCSI  generic  support
       enabled.   In ``make xconfig'', this shows up under ``SCSI
       support->SCSI generic support''.


       To keep scanning times to a minimum, it is strongly recom­
       mended  to  use  a  large buffer size for the generic SCSI
       driver. From SG driver version 2.0 on, the maximum  buffer
       size  can  be changed at program run time, and there is no
       restriction in size. This driver version is  part  of  the
       Linux  kernels from version 2.2.7 on. If the new SG driver
       is available some backends (e.g.  sane-umax,  sane-mustek,
       sane-sharp)  automatically request larger scsi buffers. If
       a backend does not automatically  request  a  larger  scsi
       buffer, set the environment variable SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE to
       the desired buffer size in bytes. It is not recommended to
       use more than 1 MB, because for large values the probabil­
       ity increases that the SG driver cannot allocate the  nec­
       essary  buffer(s). For ISA cards, even 1 MB might be a too
       large value. For a detailed discussion of memory issues of
       the SG driver, see http://www.torque.net/sg.

       For  Linux  kernels  before  version 2.2.7 the size of the
       buffer is only 32KB.  This works,  but  for  many  cheaper
       scanners this causes scanning to be slower by about a fac­
       tor of four than  when  using  a  size  of  127KB.   Linux
       defines  the  size  of this buffer by macro SG_BIG_BUFF in
       header file /usr/include/scsi/sg.h.  Unless  a  system  is
       seriously  short  on memory, it is recommended to increase
       this   value   to   the    maximum    legal    value    of
       128*1024-512=130560  bytes.  After changing this value, it
       is necessary to recompile both the  kernel  (or  the  SCSI
       generic  module)  and the SCSI backends. Keep in mind that
       this is only necessary with older Linux kernels.


       A common issue with SCSI scanners is what to do  when  you
       booted  the  system  while the scanner was turned off?  In
       such a case, the scanner won't be recognized by the kernel
       and  SANE  won't be able to access it.  Fortunately, Linux
       provides a simple mechanism to  probe  a  SCSI  device  on
       demand.   Suppose you have a scanner connected to SCSI bus
       2 and the scanner has a SCSI id of 5.  When the system  is
       up and running and the scanner is turned on, you can issue
       the command:

              echo  "scsi  add-single-device   2   0   5   0"   >
              /proc/scsi/scsi

       and the kernel will probe and recognize your scanner (this
       needs to be done as root).  It's also possible to  dynami­
       cally  remove  a SCSI device by using the ``remove-single-
       device'' command.  For details, please  refer  to  to  the
       SCSI-Programming-HOWTO.

       Scanners  are  known  to  work  with  the  following  SCSI
       adapters under Linux. This list  isn't  complete,  usually
       any SCSI adapter supported by Linux should work.


              Acard/Advance SCSI adapters
                     Some   versions   of   the   kernel   driver
                     (atp870u.c)  cut  the  inquiry  information.
                     Therefore the scanner can't be detected cor­
                     rectly.        See         http://www.meier-
                     geinitz.de/sane/trouble.html#acard   for   a
                     solution.

                     you  encounter kernel freezes or other unex­
                     pected behaviour get the latest Linux kernel
                     (2.2.17 seems to work) or reduce SCSI buffer
                     size to 32 kB.

              BusLogic BT958
                     To configure the BusLogic card, you may need
                     to follow these instructions (contributed by
                     Jeremy <jeremy@xxedgexx.com>): During  boot,
                     when your BusLogic adapter is being initial­
                     ized, press Ctrl-B to  enter  your  BusLogic
                     adapter  setup.   Choose  the  address which
                     your BusLogic  containing  your  scanner  is
                     located.  Choose  ``SCSI  Device  Configura­
                     tion''.  Choose ``Scan SCSI  Bus''.   Choose
                     whatever  SCSI id that contains your scanner
                     and then choose ``View/Modify SCSI  configu­
                     ration''.     Change    ``Negotiation''   to
                     ``async''  and  change   ``Disconnect''   to
                     ``off''.  Press  Esc,  save,  and  Esc again
                     until you are asked to reboot.

              NCR/Symbios 53c400/53c400a or  Domex  DTC3181E/L/LE
              (DTCT436/436P) ISA SCSI card
                     This card is supplied by Mustek  (and  other
                     vendors).  If  you  use  Linux 2.0.x you may
                     need a patch from  Ingmar  Baumgart's  home­
                     page:
                     http://rzstud1.rz.uni-karl­
                     sruhe.de/~uh49/mustek-scsi.html
                     The SCSI cards are supported by  the  module
                     g_NCR5380.   It's necessary to tell the ker­
                     nel the io port and type of  card.   Example
                     for    a   53c400a:   ``modprobe   g_NCR5380
                     ncr_addr=0x280  ncr_53c400a=1''.   Once  the
                     kernel  detects the card, it should work all
                     right.  However, while it  should  work,  do
                     not  expect  good  performance  out  of this
                     card---it has no interrupt line  and  there­
                     fore while a scan is in progress, the system
                     becomes almost unusable.  You may change the
                     values    of    the    USLEEP    macros   in
                     drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.c.   Some  documenta­
                     tion is in this file and NCR5380.c.

              NCR/Symbios 810
                     For some scanners it may be necssary to dis­
                     able disconnect/reconnect. To  achieve  this
                     use the option ncr53c8xx="disc:n".
                     For  Linux  kernels  before 2.0.33 it may be
                     necessary to increase the SCSI timeout.  The
                     default timeout for the Linux kernels before
                     2.0.33 is 10 seconds, which is way  too  low
                     when  scanning  large area.  If you get mes­
                     sages of the form ``restart (ncr  dead  ?)''
                     in  your  /var/log/messages  file  or on the
                     system console, it's an indication that  the
                     timeout  is  too  short.  In this case, find
                     the line ``if  (np->latetime>10)''  in  file
                     ncr53c8xx.c     (normally    in    directory
                     /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi) and change  the
                     constant  10 to, say, 60 (one minute).  Then
                     rebuild the kernel/module and try again.

              Tekram DC390
                     Version 1.11 of the Tekram driver  seems  to
                     work  fine mostly, except that the scan does
                     not terminate properly  (it  causes  a  SCSI
                     timeout  after  10  minutes).   The  generic
                     AM53C974 also seems to work  fine  and  does
                     not suffer from the timeout problems.


Solaris, OpenStep and NeXTStep
       Under  Solaris,  OpenStep  and  NeXTStep, the generic SCSI
       device name refers to a SCSI bus,  not  to  an  individual
       device.   For  example,  /dev/sg0 refers to the first SCSI
       bus.  To tell SANE which device to use, append the charac­
       ter  'a'+target-id  to the special device name.  For exam­
       ple, the SCSI device connected  to  the  first  SCSI  con­
       troller  and  with  target-id 0 would be called /dev/sg0a,
       and the device with target-id 1 on that same bus would  be
       called /dev/sg0b, and so on.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level  for  the  generic SCSI I/O subsystem.
              E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug  output  to
              be  printed  by  the  backend.  A value of 255 also
              prints kernel  messages  from  the  SCSI  subsystem
              (where  available).   Smaller  levels  reduce  ver­
              bosity.
