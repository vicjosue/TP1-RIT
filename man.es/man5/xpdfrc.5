NAME
       xpdfrc - configuration file for Xpdf tools (version 1.00)

DESCRIPTION
       All  of  the  Xpdf tools read a single configuration file.
       If you have a .xpdfrc file in your home directory, it will
       be read.  Otherwise, a system-wide configuration file will
       be read from /etc/xpdfrc, if  it  exists.   (This  is  its
       default  location;  depending  on build options, it may be
       placed elsewhere.)  On  Win32  systems,  the  xpdfrc  file
       should be placed in the same directory as the executables.

       The xpdfrc file consists  of  a  series  of  configuration
       options,  one  per  line.   Blank lines and lines starting
       with a '#' (comments) are ignored.

       The following  sections  list  all  of  the  configuration
       options, sorted into functional groups.  There is an exam­
       ples section at the end.

CHARACTER MAPPING
       nameToUnicode map-file
              Specifies a file with the  mapping  from  character
              names to Unicode.  This is used to handle PDF fonts
              that have valid encodings but no  ToUnicode  entry.
              Each line of a nameToUnicode file looks like this:

                   hex-string name

              The  hex-string  is  the  Unicode (UCS-2) character
              index, and  name  is  the  corresponding  character
              name.  Multiple nameToUnicode files can be used; if
              a character name is given more than once, the  code
              in  the  last  specified  file is used.  There is a
              built-in default nameToUnicode table  with  all  of
              Adobe's standard character names.

       cidToUnicode registry-ordering map-file
              Specifies  the file with the mapping from character
              collection to Unicode.  Each line of a cidToUnicode
              file represents one character:

                   hex-string

              The  hex-string  is  the  Unicode (UCS-2) index for
              that character.  The first line  maps  CID  0,  the
              second line CID 1, etc.  File size is determined by
              size of the character collection.  Only one file is
              allowed  per  character collection; the last speci­
              fied file is used.  There are no built-in cidToUni­
              code mappings.

       unicodeMap encoding-name map-file
              Specifies  the  file  with  mapping from Unicode to
              encoding-name.  These encodings are used for X dis­
              play  fonts and text output (see below).  Each line
              of a unicodeMap file represents a range of  one  or
              more  Unicode  characters  which maps linearly to a
              range in the output encoding:

                   in-start-hex in-end-hex out-start-hex

              Entries for single characters  can  be  abbreviated
              to:

                   in-hex out-hex

              The in-start-hex and in-end-hex fields (or the sin­
              gle in-hex field) specify the Unicode  range.   The
              out-start-hex  field  (or the out-hex field) speci­
              fies the start of the output encoding  range.   The
              length  of  the  out-start-hex  (or out-hex) string
              determines the  length  of  the  output  characters
              (e.g.,  UTF-8  uses  different  numbers of bytes to
              represent characters in different ranges).  Entries
              must  be  given  in increasing Unicode order.  Only
              one file is allowed per encoding; the  last  speci­
              fied  file  is  used.   The Latin1, ASCII7, Symbol,
              ZapfDingbats, and UTF-8 encodings are predefined.

       cMapDir registry-ordering dir
              Specifies a search directory, dir,  for  CMaps  for
              the  registry-ordering character collection.  There
              can be multiple directories for a  particular  col­
              lection.  There are no default CMap directories.

       toUnicodeDir dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory, dir, for ToUnicode
              CMaps.  There can be  multiple  ToUnicode  directo­
              ries.   There are no default ToUnicode directories.

DISPLAY FONTS
       displayFontX PDF-font-name XLFD encoding-name
              Maps a PDF font, PDF-font-name, to an X font, XLFD,
              for  display.  The XLFD (X Logical Font Descriptor)
              should contain  the  string  "%s",  which  will  be
              replaced  by  xpdf with the font size.  If the XLFD
              contains spaces it  must  be  quoted.   The  encod­
              ing-name  must  be defined with the unicodeMap com­
              mand (see above).  By default,  the  Base-14  fonts
              are  mapped  to standard X fonts, using the Latin1,
              Symbol, and ZapfDingbats encodings.

       displayFontT1 PDF-font-name T1-file
              Maps a PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a  Type  1  font
              for display.  The Type 1 font file, T1-file, should
              be a standard .pfa or .pfb file.

       displayFontTT PDF-font-name TT-file
              Maps a PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a TrueType  font
              for  display.   The  TrueType  font  file, TT-file,
              should be a standard .ttf file.

       displayCIDFontX registry-ordering XLFD encoding-name
              Maps the registry-ordering character collection  to
              the  X font, XLFD, for display.  The encoding given
              by encoding-name must  be  defined  with  the  uni­
              codeMap  command.  There are no default display CID
              font mappings.

       fontDir dir
              Specifies a  search  directory  for  external  font
              files.   There can be multiple fontDir directories.
              If a PDF file uses a font  but  doesn't  embed  it,
              these  directories  will be searched for a matching
              font file.  These fonts are used by both xpdf  (for
              display)  and  pdftops (for embedding in the gener­
              ated PostScript).   Only  files  with  suffixes  of
              ".pfa", ".pfb", or ".ttf" will be used; other files
              in these directories will be ignored.  There are no
              default fontDir directories.

POSTSCRIPT CONTROL
       psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
              Sets  the  paper  size  for PostScript output.  The
              width and height parameters give the paper size  in
              PostScript points.

       psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3
              Sets  the  paper  size  for  PostScript output to a
              standard size.  The default paper size is set  when
              xpdf  and  pdftops are built, typically to "letter"
              or "A4".

       psDuplex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the generated PostScript will  set
              the  "Duplex" pagedevice entry.  This tells duplex-
              capable  printers  to   enable   duplexing.    This
              defaults to "no".

       psLevel level1 | level1sep | level2 | level2sep
              Sets   the  PostScript  level  to  generate.   This
              defaults to "level2".

       psFont PDF-font-name PS-font-name
              When the PDF-font-name font is used in a PDF  file,
              it  will  be  translated  to  the  PostScript  font
              PS-font-name, which is assumed to  be  resident  in
              the    printer.    Typically,   PDF-font-name   and
              PS-font-name are the same.  By  default,  only  the
              Base-14 fonts are assumed to be resident.

       psEmbedType1Fonts yes | no
              If  set to "no", prevents embedding of Type 1 fonts
              in generated PostScript.  This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to  "no",  prevents  embedding  of  TrueType
              fonts  in  generated  PostScript.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       psOPI yes | no
              If set to "yes", generates PostScript OPI  comments
              for  all  images  and forms which have OPI informa­
              tion.  This option is only available  if  the  Xpdf
              tools   were   compiled  with  OPI  support.   This
              defaults to "no".

       psFile file-or-command
              Sets the default PostScript file or  print  command
              for  xpdf.   Commands  start  with a '|' character;
              anything else is a file.  If the file name or  com­
              mand  contains  spaces  it  must  be  quoted.  This
              defaults to unset, which tells xpdf to  generate  a
              name   of   the  form  <file>.ps  for  a  PDF  file
              <file>.pdf.

       fontDir dir
              See the description above,  in  the  DISPLAY  FONTS
              section.

TEXT CONTROL
       textEncoding encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to use for text output.  (This
              can be overridden with the  "-enc"  switch  on  the
              command  line.)   The encoding-name must be defined
              with the  unicodeMap  command  (see  above).   This
              defaults to "Latin1".

       textEOL unix | dos | mac
              Sets  the  end-of-line  convention  to use for text
              output.  The options are:

                  unix = LF
                  dos  = CR+LF
                  mac  = CR

              (This can be overridden with the "-eol"  switch  on
              the  command  line.)  The default value is based on
              the OS where xpdf and pdftotext were built.

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
       t1libControl none | plain | low | high
              Sets the type of font rendering for t1lib (the Type
              1  rasterizer)  to  use.  Options are "none" (don't
              use t1lib at all),  "plain"  (use  non-anti-aliased
              fonts),  "low"  or  "high"  (use low-level or high-
              level anti-aliased fonts).  This defaults to "low".

       freetypeControl none | plain | low | high
              Sets  the  type of font rendering for FreeType (the
              TrueType rasterizer) to use.   Options  are  "none"
              (don't use FreeType at all), "plain" (use non-anti-
              aliased fonts), "low" or "high"  (use  anti-aliased
              fonts;  these two are identical).  This defaults to
              "low".

       urlCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on  a  URL
              link.   The  string  "%s" will be replaced with the
              URL.  (See the example below.)  This has no default
              value.

       mapNumericCharNames yes | no
              If set to "yes", the Xpdf tools will attempt to map
              various numeric character names sometimes  used  in
              font  subsets.   In some cases this leads to usable
              text, and in other cases it leads to  gibberish  --
              there is no way for Xpdf to tell.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       errQuiet yes | no
              If set to "yes",  this  suppresses  all  error  and
              warning  messages from all of the Xpdf tools.  This
              defaults to "no".

FILES
       /etc/xpdfrc
              This is the default location  for  the  system-wide
              configuration file.  Depending on build options, it
              may be placed elsewhere.

       $HOME/.xpdfrc
              This is  the  user's  configuration  file.   If  it
              exists, it will be read in place of the system-wide
              file.
