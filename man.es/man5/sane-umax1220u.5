NAME
       sane-umax1220u  -  SANE  backend  for the UMAX Astra 1220U
       scanner


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-umax1220  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now  Easy)  backend  for  the the UMAX Astra 1220U
       scanner.

       For the latest information on this backend,  please  visit
       http://umax1220u-sane.sourceforge.net/.


UMAX ASTRA 2000U EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT
       This  backend  can  also  drive the UMAX Astra 2000U (sort
       of). You will be able to scan, but the colors will be hor­
       rible.  From  Stephane  (the  author  of  sane-umax_pp), I
       learned that there are differences in the  way  the  color
       calibration  is performed. It may be possible to use ideas
       from that backend to add complete support for the 2000U to
       this  backend.  Since  I  do  not  have access to an Astra
       2000U, I do not plan to work on this -- any volunteers?


CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  file  for  this  backend  resides   in
            /etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf.

       Its  contents is a list of device names that correspond to
       UMAX Astra 1220U scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting
       with  a  hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration
       file is shown below:

        #usb vendor product
        usb 0x1606 0x0010
        # Device list for non-linux systems
        /dev/scanner
        /dev/usb/scanner0

       When driving a Astra 2000U, use the product number 0x0030.
       See  sane-usb(5)  for information on how to set the access
       permissions on the usb device files.


FILES
       The backend configuration file:
        /etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf

       The static library implementing this backend:
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax1220u.a

       The shared library implementing this backend :
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax1220u.so
        (present on systems that support dynamic loading)


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U
        If the library was compiled with debug  support  enabled,
       this  environment  variable  controls  the debug level for
       this backend. E.g., a value  of  128  requests  all  debug
       output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce verbosity:

       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U values


        Number  Remark
        1       print failures
        2       print information
        3       print high-level function calls
        4       print high-level function checkpoints
        9       print mid-level function calls
        10      print mid-level function checkpoints
        80      print protocol-level function entry
        90      print protocol-level function exit

       Example:
         export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U=10


KNOWN BUGS
       600 dpi scanning may fail for large image sizes.

       If  you  keep getting I/O errors, try cycling the power on
       your scanner to reset it.

       There is no way to cancel a scan, since the driver ignores
       sane_cancel().

       If  you try scanning an image which is too small, you will
       get I/O errors. Be sure to adjust  the  scan  area  before
       doing a scan, since by default, the scan area is zero.

REPORTING BUGS
       When   reporting   bugs,   please  run  the  backend  with
       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U set to 10 and attach a  copy  of  the
       log messages.
