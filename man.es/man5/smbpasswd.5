SMBPASSWD(5)                                         SMBPASSWD(5)



NAME
       smbpasswd - The Samba encrypted password file

SYNOPSIS
       smbpasswd

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       smbpasswd  is  the  Samba encrypted password file. It con­
       tains the username, Unix user id and the SMB hashed  pass­
       words of the user, as well as account flag information and
       the time the password was last changed. This  file  format
       has been evolving with Samba and has had several different
       formats in the past.

FILE FORMAT
       The format of the smbpasswd file used by Samba 2.2 is very
       similar  to  the  familiar  Unix  passwd(5) file. It is an
       ASCII file containing one line for each user.  Each  field
       ithin each line is separated from the next by a colon. Any
       entry beginning with '#' is ignored.  The  smbpasswd  file
       contains the following information for each user:

       name   This  is  the  user  name.  It  must be a name that
              already exists in the standard UNIX passwd file.

       uid    This is the UNIX uid. It must match the  uid  field
              for the same user entry in the standard UNIX passwd
              file.  If this  does  not  match  then  Samba  will
              refuse  to  recognize  this smbpasswd file entry as
              being valid for a user.

       Lanman Password Hash
              This is the LANMAN hash  of  the  user's  password,
              encoded  as  32 hex digits. The LANMAN hash is cre­
              ated by DES encrypting a well known string with the
              user's  password  as  the DES key. This is the same
              password used by Windows 95/98 machines.  Note that
              this  password  hash  is  regarded as weak as it is
              vulnerable to dictionary attacks and if  two  users
              choose the same password this entry will be identi­
              cal (i.e. the password is not "salted" as the  UNIX
              password  is). If the user has a null password this
              field will contain the characters "NO PASSWORD"  as
              the  start  of the hex string. If the hex string is
              equal to 32 'X' characters then the user's  account
              is marked as disabled and the user will not be able
              to log onto the Samba server.

              WARNING !! Note that, due to the challenge-response
              nature  of  the  SMB/CIFS  authentication protocol,
              anyone with a knowledge of this password hash  will
              be able to impersonate the user on the network. For
              this reason these hashes are known  as  plain  text
              equivalents  and must NOT be made available to any­
              one but the root user. To protect  these  passwords
              the  smbpasswd  file  is placed in a directory with
              read and traverse access only to the root user  and
              the  smbpasswd  file  itself  must  be  set  to  be
              read/write only by root, with no other access.

       NT Password Hash
              This is the Windows NT hash of the user's password,
              encoded  as  32  hex digits. The Windows NT hash is
              created by taking the  user's  password  as  repre­
              sented  in  16-bit,  little-endian UNICODE and then
              applying the MD4 (internet rfc1321)  hashing  algo­
              rithm to it.

              This  password  hash is considered more secure than
              the LANMAN Password Hash as it preserves  the  case
              of  the  password  and  uses  a much higher quality
              hashing algorithm.  However, it is still  the  case
              that  if  two  users  choose the same password this
              entry will be identical (i.e. the password  is  not
              "salted" as the UNIX password is).

              WARNING  !!.  Note  that,  due  to  the  challenge-
              response nature of the SMB/CIFS authentication pro­
              tocol,  anyone  with  a  knowledge of this password
              hash will be able to impersonate the  user  on  the
              network.  For this reason these hashes are known as
              plain text equivalents and must NOT be made  avail­
              able  to anyone but the root user. To protect these
              passwords the smbpasswd file is placed in a  direc­
              tory with read and traverse access only to the root
              user and the smbpasswd file itself must be  set  to
              be read/write only by root, with no other access.

       Account Flags
              This  section  contains  flags  that  describe  the
              attributes of the users account. In the  Samba  2.2
              release  this  field  is  bracketed  by '[' and ']'
              characters and is always 13  characters  in  length
              (including  the  '[' and ']' characters).  The con­
              tents of this field may be any of the characters.

              · U - This means this is a "User" account, i.e.  an
                ordinary  user.  Only  User and Workstation Trust
                accounts are currently supported in the smbpasswd
                file.

              · N  -  This means the account has no password (the
                passwords in the fields LANMAN Password Hash  and
                NT  Password  Hash  are  ignored). Note that this
                will only allow users to log on with no  password
                if  the   null  passwords parameter is set in the
                smb.conf(5) config file.

              · D - This means the account  is  disabled  and  no
                SMB/CIFS logins will be allowed for this user.

              · W  -  This  means  this account is a "Workstation
                Trust" account. This kind of account is  used  in
                the  Samba  PDC  code  stream to allow Windows NT
                Workstations and Servers to join a Domain  hosted
                by a Samba PDC.

       Other  flags  may  be  added  as  the  code is extended in
       future.  The rest of this field space is  filled  in  with
       spaces.


       Last Change Time
              This  field  consists  of  the time the account was
              last modified. It consists of the characters 'LCT-'
              (standing  for  "Last  Change  Time") followed by a
              numeric encoding of the UNIX time in seconds  since
              the epoch (1970) that the last change was made.

       All other colon separated fields are ignored at this time.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
