MENUFILE(5L)                                         MENUFILE(5L)



NAME
       menufile - entry in the Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.menu/*

       /etc/menu/*

       /usr/lib/menu/*

       /usr/lib/menu/default/*

DESCRIPTION
       Menu files add entries to the Debian menu system. The sys­
       tem administrator can place menu files  in  /etc/menu/  to
       override  menu files that packages add to /usr/lib/menu/ .
       The user can place menu files in ~/.menu/ to override  all
       other menu files.

       This  man  page may be out of date in some places. Look at
       /usr/doc/menu/html for more up-to-date info.

       The menu files are usually named after the Debian  package
       that  contains the programs listed in them. In it, you can
       list several "menuentries", that specify a  specific  item
       in  the  menu "menu entries", that specify a specific item
       in the menu structure.  Each  menu  entry  specifies  what
       package  it  depends on, if that package is not installed,
       the menu entry will be ignored by update-menus(1).  (In  a
       menu entry you can specify pseudo-packages that start with
       "local.",  update-menus  will  always   use   those   menu
       entries).   If  you  wish  to remove an item from the menu
       entirely, make an empty menu file with the  same  name  as
       the file you want to override.

Examples
       Dosemu   could   install   the   following  menu  file  as
       /usr/lib/menu/dosemu:

        ?package(dosemu):needs=text        section=Apps/Emulators
       title="Dosemu" command=dosemu
        ?package(dosemu):needs=x11         section=Apps/Emulators
       title="Dosemu" command=xdos

       The system administrator wants to override  this  file  to
       change how dosemu is run, so /etc/menu/dosemu is created:

        ?package(dosemu):needs=text        section=Apps/Emulators
       title="Dosemu" command="dosemu -A"
        ?package(dosemu):needs=x11         section=Apps/Emulators
       title="Dosemu" command="xdos -A"

       A user does not want Dosemu to appear on his menus at all,
       so he creates an empty file named ~/.menu/dosemu .

FORMAT
       A menu file consists of 0 or more lines of  the  following
       format:

              ?package(package-name):var1=value var2=varlue2  ...

              needs= What type of display will  the  program  run
                     on?  This  variable  must  be  defined,  and
                     should be one of the following:

                     needs=text
                             any text display

                     needs=x11
                             X11 displays

                     needs=vc
                             At the Linux console (i.e.:  svgalib
                             programs)

                     needs=wm
                             A window manager.

                     needs=fvwmmodule
                             A  fvwm  version 1.x compatible mod­
                             ule.

                     needs=fvwm2module
                             A fvwm version 2.x  compatible  mod­
                             ule.

              section
                     The  section  in which the menu entry should
                     appear. See MENU LAYOUT for  preferred  sec­
                     tion names.

              icon   An  icon  for this menu entry. If no icon is
                     available,   just   don't    define    this.
                     (icon="none"  is  also  possible, preferably
                     just leave it out)

              title  The title of the program that will appear on
                     the  menus.  Keep  it  short.   If  two menu
                     entries share the same  title  and  section,
                     the  one  that bests fits the available dis­
                     play will be used. So in the  example  above
                     with  two  menu  entries  that both have the
                     menu id "title", if X is available, the  x11
                     one  will  be  used,  otherwise the text one
                     will be used.  Must be defined.

              command
                     The command to be executed  when  this  menu
                     entry is selected.

MENU LAYOUT
       This is the preferred layout of the menus. Currently it is
       a suggestion only. Use `/' to separate sub-menu names, for
       example, "Apps/Editors" or "Games/Arcade".

        Apps            -- all normal apps
          Editors       -- editors
          Emulators     -- Dosemu, ...
          Graphics      -- xpaint, xfig, xtiff,
          Math          -- Math apps: gnuplot, octave, oleo,..
          Net           -- mail, news, web, irc, etc
          Programming   -- debuggers, etc
          Shells         -- Different shells, like bash, zsh, ...
          Sound         --
          System        -- system administration and monitoring
          Tools         -- other tools: xclock, xmag, xman,
          Viewers       -- Picture viewers, gs, ...
        Games           -- games and recreations
          Adventure      --  walk  around  virtual  space,  zork,
       MOO's, etc
          Arcade        -- (any game where reflexes count)
          Board         -- Like: Gnuchess, pente, gnugo
          Card          -- solitaire, etc
          Puzzles       -- Stuff from xpuzzles, ...
          Sports        -- Games derived from "real world" sports
          Tetris-like   -- games involving falling blocks
          Toys          -- (oneko, xeyes, etc.)
        Screen          --
          Lock          -- xlock, etc.
          Screen-saver  --
          Root-window   -- things that fill the root window
        Window-managers -- (change between fvwm, afterstep, etc)
          Modules       -- fvwm modules, etc.
        XShells         -- shells (like xterm, rxvt, ...)

NOTES
       If you want to specify an icon or hotkey  for  a  sub-menu
       (for  example,  the  Editors  sub-menu), just use the same
       syntax but leave the command empty:

       ?package(mypackage):needs=X11  section=Apps  icon=icon.xpm
       hotkey=E title="Editors"


       Whenever  any menu files are changed, you must run update-
       menus(1)
