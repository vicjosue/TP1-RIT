LDAPFILTER.CONF(5)                             LDAPFILTER.CONF(5)



NAME
       ldapfilter.conf  -  configuration file for LDAP get filter
       routines

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/ldapfilter.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/openldap/ldapfilter.conf  contains  informa­
       tion  used  by the LDAP get filter routines (see ldap-get­
       filter(3)).  Blank lines and lines that have a first char­
       acter  of  `#'  are  treated as comments and ignored.  The
       configuration information consists of lines  that  contain
       one,  two,  three, four, or five tokens.  Tokens are sepa­
       rated by white space, and double quotes `"' can be used to
       include white space inside a token.

       The  file  consists  of  a  sequence of one or more filter
       sets.  A filter set begins with a line containing a single
       token called a tag.  The tag is used in the ldap_getfirst­
       filter(3) call to select the filter set.

       The filter set consists of a sequence of one or more  fil­
       ter  lists.   The first line in a filter list must contain
       four or five tokens:  the  value  pattern,  the  delimiter
       list,  a  filter  template,  a  match  description, and an
       optional search scope.  The value  pattern  is  a  regular
       expression that is matched against the value passed to the
       ldap_getfirstfilter(3) call to select the filter list.

       The delimiter list is a list of characters (in the form of
       a  single  string)  that  are used to break the value into
       distinct words.

       The filter template is used to construct  an  LDAP  filter
       (it is described further below)

       The match description is returned to the called along with
       a filter as a piece of text that can be used  to  describe
       the  sort  of LDAP search that took place.  It should cor­
       rectly compete both of the following phrases:  "One  match
       description  match  was  found  for..."   and "Three match
       description matches were found for...."

       The search scope is optional, and should be one of "base",
       "onelevel",  or  "subtree".   If  search scope is not pro­
       vided, the default is "subtree".

       The remaining lines of the filter list should contain  two
       or  three  tokens,  a filter template, a match description
       and an optional search scope (as described above).

       The filter template is similar in concept to  a  printf(3)
       style format string.  Everything is taken literally except
       for the character sequences:
           %v
           %v$
           %vN
           %vM-N
           %vN-
       A plain %v means to substitute the entire value string  in
       place  of  the  %v.  %v$ means substitute the last word in
       this spot.  A %vN, where N is a single  digit  1-9,  means
       substitute  word  N  in  this spot.  Words are number from
       left to right within the value starting at  1.   A  %vM-N,
       where M and N are both single digits 1-9, means substitute
       the indicated sequence of words.  A %vN-, where N is again
       a  single  digit  1-9, means substitute word N through the
       last word in value.

EXAMPLE
       The following ldap filter configuration file contains  two
       filter  sets  (finger and go500gw onelevel), each of which
       contains four filter lists.

         # ldap filter file
         #
         finger
           "="                " "     "%v"                    "arbitrary filter"

           "[0-9][0-9-]*"    " "     "(telephoneNumber=*%v)" "phone number"

           "@"                " "     "(mail=%v)"             "email address"

           "^.[. _].*"       ". _"   "(cn=%v1* %v2-)"        "first initial"

           ".*[. _].$"        ". _"   "(cn=%v1-*)"            "last initial"

           "[. _]"            ". _"   "(|(sn=%v1-)(cn=%v1-))"        "exact"
                                      "(|(sn~=%v1-)(cn~=%v1-))"      "approximate"

           ".*"               ". "    "(|(cn=%v1)(sn=%v1)(uid=%v1))" "exact"
                                      "(|(cn~=%v1)(sn~=%v1))"        "approximate"

         "go500gw onelevel"
           "^..$"  " "   "(|(o=%v)(c=%v)(l=%v)(co=%v))"       "exact" "onelevel"
                         "(|(o~=%v)(c~=%v)(l~=%v)(co~=%v))"   "approximate" "onelevel"

           " "     " "   "(|(o=%v)(l=%v)(co=%v)"       "exact"        "onelevel"
                         "(|(o~=%v)(l~=%v)(co~=%v)"    "approximate"  "onelevel"

           "."    " "   "(associatedDomain=%v)"       "exact"        "onelevel"

           ".*"    " "   "(|(o=%v)(l=%v)(co=%v)"       "exact"        "onelevel"
                         "(|(o~=%v)(l~=%v)(co~=%v)"    "approximate"  "onelevel"

       The call ldap_getfirstfilter( lfdp, "finger", "m.smith" );
       will  return an LDAPFiltInfo structure with the lfi_filter
       member  containing  the  string  (cn=m*  smith)  with  the
       lfi_desc  member  containing the string first initial, and
       lfi_scope containing the value LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE.

       The call ldap_getfirstfilter(  lfdp,  "go500gw  onelevel",
       "umich"  ); will return an LDAPFiltInfo structure with the
       lfi_filter     member      containing      the      string
       (|(o=umich)(l=umich)(co=umich)  with  the  lfi_desc member
       containing the string exact, and lfi_scope containing  the
       value LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL.
