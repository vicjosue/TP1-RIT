FTPUSERS(5)                File formats               FTPUSERS(5)



NAME
       ftpusers  -  list of users that may not log in via the FTP
       daemon

DESCRIPTION
       The text file ftpusers contains a list of users  that  may
       not  log  in using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server
       daemon. This file is used not merely for  system  adminis­
       tration  purposes  but  for  improving  security  within a
       TCP/IP networked environment. It will typically contain  a
       list  of  the users that either have no business using ftp
       or have too many  privileges  to  be  allowed  to  log  in
       through the FTP server daemon.  Such users usually include
       root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.   If  your  FTP  server
       daemon  doesn't use ftpusers then it is suggested that you
       read its documentation to find out how to block access for
       certain  users.  Washington  University  FTP server Daemon
       (wuftpd) and Professional FTP Daemon (proftpd)  are  known
       to make use of ftpusers.

FORMAT
       The  format  of  ftpusers  is  very  simple.  There is one
       account name (or user name) per line.  Lines starting with
       a # are ignored.

FILES
       /etc/ftpusers
