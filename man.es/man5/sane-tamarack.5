NAME
       sane-tamarack - SANE backend for Tamarack flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-tamarack  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now Easy) backend that provides access to the fol­
       lowing Tamarack flatbed scanners:

              Artiscan 6000C
              Artiscan 8000C
              Artiscan 12000C


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds  to  a  SCSI  scanner. The special device name
       must be a generic SCSI device  or  a  symlink  to  such  a
       device.   The  program sane-find-scanner helps to find out
       the correct device. Under Linux, such a device name  could
       be  /dev/sga  or  /dev/sge, for example.  See sane-scsi(5)
       for details.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/tamarack.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-tamarack.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-tamarack.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_TAMARACK
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  Higher debug  levels
              increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_TAMARACK=4
