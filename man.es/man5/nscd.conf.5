nscd.conf(5)                                         nscd.conf(5)



NAME
       /etc/nscd.conf  -  name service cache daemon configuration
       file

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/nscd.conf is read from nscd(8)  at  startup.
       Each line specifies either an attribute and a value, or an
       attribute, service, and  a  value.  Fields  are  separated
       either  by  SPACE  or  TAB characters. A `#' (number sign)
       indicates the beginning of a  comment;  following  charac­
       ters,  up  to  the end of the line, are not interpreted by
       nscd.


       Valid services are passwd, group, or hosts.

       logfile debug-file-name
              Specifies name of the  file  to  which  debug  info
              should be written.

       debug-level value
              Sets the desired debug level.

       threads number
              This  is  the number of threads that are started to
              wait for  requests.  At  least  five  threads  will
              always be created.

       server-user user
              If  this  option is set, nscd will run as this user
              and not as root.  If a  separate  cache  for  every
              user   is  used  (-S  parameter),  this  option  is
              ignored.

       enable-cache service <yes|no>
              Enables or disables the specified service cache.

       positive-time-to-live service value
              Sets the TTL (time-to-live)  for  positive  entries
              (successful  queries)  in  the  specified cache for
              service.   Value  is  in  seconds.  Larger   values
              increase  cache  hit rates and reduce mean response
              times, but increase problems with cache  coherence.

       negative-time-to-live service value
              Sets  the  TTL  (time-to-live) for negative entries
              (unsuccessful queries) in the specified  cache  for
              service.   Value  is in seconds. Can result in sig­
              nificant performance improvements if there are sev­
              eral  files  owned by uids (user IDs) not in system
              databases (for example untarring the  linux  kernel
              sources  as  root);  should be kept small to reduce
              cache coherency problems.

       suggested-size service value
              This is the internal hash table size, value  should
              remain a prime number for optimum efficiency.

       check-files service <yes|no>
              Enables  or disables checking the file belonging to
              the specified service for changes.  The  files  are
              /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/hosts.
