NAME
       gimprc - gimp configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  gimprc  file  is a configuation file read by the gimp
       when it starts up.  There are two of  these:  one  system-
       wide  one  stored  in  /etc/gimp/1.2/gimprc and a per-user
       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/gimprc which may override system settings.

       Comments  are  introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue
       until the end of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

       The gimprc file associates values with properties.   These
       properties  may  be  set  by  lisp-like assignments of the
       form:

              (property-name   value)

       where:

       property-name
                 is one of the property names described below.

       value     is the value the property is to be set to.


       Either spaces or tabs may be used  to  separate  the  name
       from the value.

       The values have an associated type, described below:

       STRING A  sequence  of  characters  surrounded  by double-
              quotes (").  A backslash (\) may be used to  escape
              either double-quote or itself to generate a literal
              double-quote or a literal backslash.

       PATH   Same as STRING, but path-expansion (see  below)  is
              also performed.

       DOUBLE An optional minus sign (-) followed by zero or more
              decimal digits, and optionally a decimal-point  (.)
              followed by zero or more decimal digits.

       FLOAT  Same as DOUBLE.

       INT    Same  as DOUBLE, except the value is rounded to the
              next lowest integer.

       BOOLEAN
              One of true, on, yes, false, off, or no.   Alterna­
              tively,  the  empty  string  is interpreted to mean
              true.

       POSITION
              Same as two INTs separated by whitespace.

       MEMSIZE
              An INT followed by a size specifier.  A size speci­
              fier is one of m, M, k, K, b, or B.  The size spec­
              ified may be omitted, in which case it defaults  to
              k.

       IMAGETYPE
              One of rgb, grey, or gray.

       COLORCUBE
              Four  whitespace  separated INTs, giving the number
              of shades of red, green,  blue  and  grey  (respec­
              tively) in the color cube.

       PREVIEWSIZE
              One of none, tiny, small, medium, large or huge, or
              an INT.  tiny is 24x24, small is 32x32,  medium  is
              48x48, large is 64x64 and huge is 128x128.

       UNIT   One of inches, millimeters, picas, or points or the
              identifier of one of the units you have defined  in
              your user units database.


PROPERTIES
       Valid properties and their types:

       temp-path PATH
              Set  the  temporary  storage  directory. Files will
              appear here during the course of running the  gimp.
              Most  files will disappear when the gimp exits, but
              some files are likely to remain,  such  as  working
              palette  files, so it is best if this directory not
              be one that is shared by other users or is  cleared
              on machine reboot such as /tmp.

       swap-path PATH
              Set  the  swap  file location. The gimp uses a tile
              based memory allocation scheme. The  swap  file  is
              used  to  quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk
              and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily
              get  very  large  if  the  gimp  is used with large
              images.  Also, things can get horribly slow if  the
              swap file is created on a directory that is mounted
              over NFS.  For these reasons, it may  be  desirable
              to put your swap file in "/tmp".

       brush-path PATH
              Set  the  brush  search path. This is a colon-sepa­
              rated  list  of  directories  to  be  searched  for
              brushes.

       pattern-path PATH
              Set the pattern search path.  This is a colon-sepa­
              rated list of directories to be searched  for  pat­
              terns.

       plug-in-path PATH
              Set  the plug-in search path. This is a colon-sepa­
              rated list of directories which will be scanned  at
              startup to register new plugins.

       palette-path PATH
              Set the palette search path.  This is a colon-sepa­
              rated  list  of  directories  to  be  searched  for
              palettes.

       gradient-path PATH
              Set the gradient search path.  This is a colon-sep­
              arated list of directories to be searched for  gra­
              dients.

       module-path PATH
              Set  the  module search path. This is a colon-sepa­
              rated list of directories which will be scanned  at
              startup for modules to be loaded.

       default-brush STRING
              Specify  a default brush.  This doesn't actually do
              anything any more, since the default brush  is  set
              as part of the saved device status.

       default-pattern STRING
              Specify  a default pattern. The pattern is searched
              for in the specified pattern path.

       default-palette STRING
              Specify a default palette.  The palette is searched
              for in the specified palette path.

       default-gradient STRING
              Specify   a   default  gradient.  The  gradient  is
              searched for in the specified gradient path.

       gamma-correction DOUBLE
              Set the gamma correction  value  for  the  display.
              1.0  corresponds  to no gamma correction.  For most
              displays, gamma correction should be set to between
              2.0  and  2.6  Run  the  utility "gamma_correct" to
              determine appropriate values for your display.  XXX
              is  this valid info?  One important item to keep in
              mind: Many images that you might get  from  outside
              sources  will  in  all likelihood already be gamma-
              corrected.  In these cases,  the  image  will  look
              washed-out  if the gimp has gamma-correction turned
              on.  If you are going to work with images  of  this
              sort,  turn  gamma  correction  off  by setting the
              value to 1.0.

       color-cube COLORCUBE
              Set the displays color cube.   No  longer  used  in
              gimp-1.2.x since the introduction of GdkRgb.

       install-colormap BOOLEAN
              Install  a  private colormap by default - not actu­
              ally used anymore since the introduction of GdkRgb.

       tile-cache-size MEMSIZE
              The  tile  cache  is  used  to  make  sure the gimp
              doesn't thrash tiles between memory and disk.  Set­
              ting  this  value higher will cause the gimp to use
              less swap space, but will also cause  the  gimp  to
              use  more  memory. Conversely, a smaller cache size
              causes the gimp to use more  swap  space  and  less
              memory.   Note:  the  gimp  will  still run even if
              `tile-cache-size' is set to 0. The actual size  can
              contain  a suffix of 'm', 'M', size as being speci­
              fied in  megabytes,  kilobytes  and  bytes  respec­
              tively. If no suffix is specified the size defaults
              to being specified in kilobytes.

       marching-ants-speed INT
              Speed of marching ants in  the  selection  outline.
              This  value is in milliseconds (less time indicates
              faster marching).

       last-opened-size INT
              How many recently opened image filenames to keep on
              the File menu.

       undo-levels INT
              Set  the  number  of  operations  kept  on the undo
              stack.

       transparency-type INT
              Set the manner in which transparency  is  displayed
              in  images.   Transparency  type  can be one of 0 -
              Light Checks, 1 - Mid-Tone Checks, 2 - Dark Checks,
              3 - White Only, 4 - Gray Only, or 5 - Black Only.

       transparency-size INT
              Check  size can be one of 0 - Small, 1 - Medium, or
              2 - Large

       perfect-mouse BOOLEAN
              If set to true, the X server  is  queried  for  the
              mouse's  current  position  on  each  motion event,
              rather than relying on  the  position  hint.   This
              means  painting  with  large brushes should be more
              accurate, but it may  be  slower.   Perversely,  on
              some  X  servers  turning on this option results in
              faster painting.

       colormap-cycling BOOLEAN
              Specify that marching  ants  for  selected  regions
              will  be  drawn  with colormap cycling as oposed to
              redrawing with different stipple masks.  This color
              cycling option works only with 8-bit displays.

       default-threshold INT
              Tools  such  as  fuzzy-select  and bucket fill find
              regions based on a seed-fill algorithm.   The  seed
              fill starts at the intially selected pixel and pro­
              gresses in all directions until the  difference  of
              pixel intensity from the original is greater than a
              specified threshold.   This  value  represents  the
              default threshold.

       stingy-memory-use BOOLEAN
              There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and
              speed.  In most cases, the GIMP opts for speed over
              memory.   However,  if  memory  is a big issue, set
              stingy-memory-use.

       allow-resize-windows BOOLEAN
              When zooming into and out of  images,  this  option
              enables the automatic resizing of windows.

       dont-allow-resize-windows BOOLEAN
              Negated version of allow-resize-windows.

       cursor-updating BOOLEAN
              Context-dependent   cursors  are  cool.   They  are
              enabled by default.  However, they require overhead
              that you may want to do without.

       no-cursor-updating BOOLEAN
              Negated version of cursor-updating.

       preview-size PREVIEWSIZE
              Set the layer preview size.

       show-rulers BOOLEAN
              Set  the  ruler visibility. The default behavior is
              for rulers to be on.  This can also be toggled with
              the View->Toggle Rulers command or shift+control+r.

       dont-show-rulers BOOLEAN
              Negated version of show-rulers.

       show-statusbar BOOLEAN
              Controlling  statusbar  visibility.   The   default
              behavior  is  to show the statusbar.  This can also
              be toggled with the View->Toggle Statusbar  command
              or shift+control+s.

       dont-show-statusbar BOOLEAN
              Negated version of show-statusbar.

       auto-save BOOLEAN
              Auto saving is not yet implemented! Nothing will be
              auto-saved, no matter how you set this.

       dont-auto-save BOOLEAN
              Negated version of auto-save.

       cubic-interpolation BOOLEAN
              Set the  level  of  interpolation.   If  set,  this
              option  enables cubic interpolation when scaling or
              transforming.  By default, GIMP uses linear  inter­
              polation,  which is faster, but has poorer quality.

       confirm-on-close BOOLEAN
              Ask for confirmation before closing an image  with­
              out saving. This is the default.

       dont-confirm-on-close BOOLEAN
              Negated version of confirm-on-close.

       save-session-info BOOLEAN
              Remember  the  positions  and  sizes  of  the  main
              dialogs and asks your window-manager to place  them
              there again the next time you use the GIMP.

       dont-save-session-info BOOLEAN
              Negated version of save-session-info.

       save-device-status BOOLEAN
              Remember  the  current  tool,  pattern,  color, and
              brush across GIMP sessions.

       dont-save-device-status BOOLEAN
              Negated version of save-device-status.

       always-restore-session BOOLEAN
              Let GIMP try to restore your last saved session.

       show-tips BOOLEAN
              Set to display a handy GIMP tip on startup.

       dont-show-tips BOOLEAN
              Negated version of show-tips.

       show-tool-tips BOOLEAN
              Set to display tooltips in the toolbox.

       dont-show-tool-tips BOOLEAN
              Negated version of show-tool-tips.

       default-image-size POSITION
              Set the default image size in the File/New  dialog.

       default-image-type IMAGETYPE
              Set  the default image type in the File/New dialog.

       default-units UNIT
              Set the default units for new images  and  for  the
              File/New dialog.  This units will be used for coor­
              dinate display when not in  dot-for-dot  mode.  The
              default  units  can be one of inches , millimeters,
              points or picas or the identifier  of  one  of  the
              units  defined  in  your  user  units database. The
              default is inches.

       default-xresolution FLOAT
              Set  the  default  horizontal  resolution  for  new
              images  and  for the File/New dialog. This value is
              always in dpi (dots per inch).

       default-yresolution FLOAT
              Set the default vertical resolution for new  images
              and  for  the File/New dialog. This value is always
              in dpi (dots per inch).

       default-resolution-units UNIT
              Set the units for the display of the default  reso­
              lution  in the File/New dialog. The default resolu­
              tion units  can  be  one  of  inches,  millimeters,
              points  or  picas  or  the identifier of one of the
              units defined  in  your  user  unit  database.  The
              default is inches.

       monitor-xresolution FLOAT
              Set  the  monitor's  horizontal resolution, in dots
              per inch.  If set to 0, forces the X server  to  be
              queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution
              information.

       monitor-yresolution FLOAT
              Set the monitor's vertical resolution, in dots  per
              inch.   If  set  to  0,  forces  the X server to be
              queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution
              information.

       num-processors INT
              On  multiprocessor  machines, if GIMP has been com­
              piled with --enable-mp this sets how  many  proces­
              sors GIMP should use simultaneously.

       image-title-format STRING
              Set  the  text  to  appear  in image window titles.
              Certain % character sequences  are  recognised  and
              expanded as follows:

              %%  literal percent sign
              %f  bare filename, or "Untitled"
              %F  full path to file, or "Untitled"
              %p  PDB image id
              %i  view instance number
              %t  image type (RGB, indexed, greyscale)
              %z  zoom factor as a percentage
              %s  source scale factor
              %d  destination scale factor
              %Dx  expands  to x if the image is dirty, the empty
              string otherwise.  The x can be any  character,  eg
              %D*.

              The default format string is "%f-%p.%i (%t)".



PATH EXPANSION
       Strings  of  type PATH are expanded in a manner similar to
       bash(1).  Specifically:  tilde  (~)  is  expanded  to  the
       user's  home directory, and ${variable} is expanded to the
       current value of the variable.  Note that the bash feature
       of being able to refer to other user's home directories by
       writing ~userid/ is not valid in this file.

       The only variable initially defined is gimp_dir , which is
       set to either the interned value .gimp-1.2 or the environ­
       ment variable GIMP_DIRECTORY.  If the path in  GIMP_DIREC­
       TORY  is  relative, it is considered relative to your home
       directory.  The same variable expansion syntax can be used
       to  refer  to environment variables.  New variables may be
       defined so long as their name does not shadow one  of  the
       property  names  given in the previous section.  Variables
       are set using the following syntax:

              (variable-name   PATH)

       Note that the right hand side of this assignment is itself
       path expanded before setting the value of the variable.

       Typically, the system-wide gimprc file will set a few con­
       venience variables:

       prefix The installation prefix for this build, /usr.

       exec_prefix
              The  path  to  architecture-specific   executables,
              ${prefix}.

       gimp_data_dir
              Path to sharable data, ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2.

       gimp_plugin_dir
              Base for paths to architecture-specific plugins and
              modules, ${exec_prefix}/lib/gimp/1.2.
