NAME
       sane-nec - SANE backend for NEC scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-nec library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides access to NEC  SCSI  scanners.
       This  backend should be considered alpha-quality software!
       In the current state it is known to work with  PC-IN500/4C
       scanners.  Another  MultiReader scanner series is not sup­
       ported. PC-IN 500/4C and MultiReader scanner are only sold
       in Japan.(except Multi Reader PetiScan.)

       For other scanners, it may or may not work.

       The backend has the following known problems:
              - ColorLineart mode is not supported.
              - device name is fixed to /dev/scanner

       At  present, the following scanners are known to work with
       this backend.
              Vendor Product id
              ------ -----------
              NEC    PC-IN500/4C


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/nec.conf
              The backend configuration file.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-nec.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-nec.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_NEC
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
