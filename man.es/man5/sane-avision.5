NAME
       sane-avision  -  SANE  backend  for  Avision  (and OEM HP,
       Minolta) flatbed scanners


ABOUT THIS FILE
       This file only is a short descripton of the  avision-back­
       end for sane!


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-avision library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access to Avision  flatbed
       scanners and the Avision OEM scanners labelled with HP and
       Minolta.


CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  file  for  this  backend  resides   in
            /etc/sane.d/avision.conf.

       Its  contents is a list of device names that correspond to
       Avision and Avision compatible scanners. Empty  lines  and
       lines  starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample
       configuration file is shown below:

       I suggest you hold one hand on  the  power-button  of  the
       scanner while you try the first scans!

        #scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN
        scsi AVISION
        /dev/scanner

        # this is a comment
        #
        option force-a4
        option allow-usb
        option disable-gamma-table

        - force-a4:
          Forces the backend to overwrite the scanable area
          returned by the scanner. This might be needed for
          the AV 630 which returns no area - or newer scanners
          which retuns the area in a unkown format our backend
          doesn't recongize yet.

        - allow-usb:
          Tells the backend to use USB scanner - which do not
          work correctly yet.

        - disable-gamma-table:
          Disables the usage of the scanner's gamma-table. You
          might try this if your scans hang, or only produces
          random garbage.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to a SCSI scanner.  The  special  device  name
       must  be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symlink to such a
       device.  The program sane-find-scanner helps to  find  out
       the  correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could
       be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for  example.   See  sane-scsi(5)
       for details.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/avision.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-avision.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-avision.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_AVISION
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level for this backend.  Higher debug levels
              increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_AVISION=4
