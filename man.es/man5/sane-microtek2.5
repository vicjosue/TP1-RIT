NAME
       sane-microtek2  -  SANE backend for Microtek scanners with
       SCSI-2 command set

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-microtek2  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now Easy) backend that provides access to Microtek
       scanners with a SCSI-2 command set.  This backend  can  be
       considered alpha to beta. Some scanner models are reported
       to work well, others not. New development versions of this
       backend    can    be    obtained    from    http://home.t-
       online.de/home/karsten.festag

       There exists a different  backend  for  Microtek  scanners
       with  SCSI-1  command  set.  Refer to sane-microtek(5) for
       details.

       And there is work in progress for the ScanMaker 3600.  See
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm3600

       At present, the following scanners are known positively to
       work with this backend:

       If you own a Microtek scanner other than the  ones  listed
       above,  it  may  or  may not work with SANE! Because equal
       scanners are sold under different names in different coun­
       tries your model may be equivalent to one of the above.

       The  parport scanners work with the ppscsi + onscsi kernel
       modules. See http://www.torque.net/parport/ppscsi.html

       The USB scanners work with the microtek kernel module. You
       may  have  to add the vendor and model codes to microtek.c
       if they aren't yet listed there.

       Both parport and USB scanners need the generic  SCSI  sup­
       port, so check if you have loaded the scsi_mod and sg mod­
       ules!

       If you try your scanner for the first time keep an eye  on
       it.  If  it  gets  commands that it doesn't understand the
       scanhead may go beyond the scan area.   The  scanner  then
       makes strange noises. In this case immedieately switch off
       the scanner or disconnect its power cable to prevent  dam­
       ages!

       If  your  scanner  is a different one than the models men­
       tioned above and it is  working  please  tell  the  author
       about  it.  It  would be nice if you add a logfile to this
       information (creation of the logfile: see below).

       If your scanner is not working properly  you  also  should
       create  a  logfile  and send it to the author. He will use
       the information to improve the backend and  possibly  make
       your scanner work.

       How to create the logfile?

       - put the line
              "option dump 2" into your microtek2.conf
               file or change the existing "option dump" to "2"

       - in a terminal (bash) type
              "export SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=30" and then
              "scanimage -l0 -t0 -x100 -y20 2>scan.log >sout.pnm"
              You get two files: scan.log  contains  the  logfile
              and  sout.pnm  the  scanned  image  (if  there  was
              scanned something). Zip them before sending.


FRONTEND OPTIONS
       This backend dynamically enables the options for the fron­
       tend,  that  are supported by the scanner in dependence of
       the  scanning-mode  and  other  options.   Not   supported
       options are disabled.

       The    following    options    are    supported   by   the
       Microtek2-driver:

       Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.

       Highlight, midtone, shadow, contrast, brightness, exposure
       time  control,  gamma  correction, threshold (dependent of
       the scan mode and the scanner capabilities)

       Transparency media adapter, automatic document feeder

       Additional options can  be  enabled  or  disabled  in  the
       microtek2.conf file. See the configuration section of this
       manpage.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special device
       that  corresponds to the scanner.  The special device name
       must be a generic SCSI device  or  a  symlink  to  such  a
       device.  Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga
       or /dev/sge for example.

CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  file  for  this  backend  resides   in
       /etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf  Its  contents  is  a  list  of
       device names that correspond  to  Microtek  scanners  with
       SCSI-2  interface.  Empty  lines and lines starting with a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.

       The configuration file may also  contain  options.  Global
       options  that  are  valid for all devices are placed above
       the device names. Device-specific options are placed under
       the device name. Note that, except for option dump <n> and
       option strip-height <n>, the entry in  the  microtek2.conf
       file  only  enables  the  corresponding  option  for being
       showed in the frontend. There, in the  frontend,  you  can
       switch  the  options  on and off.  Currently the following
       options are supported:

              option dump <n>
              option strip-height <n>
              option no-backtrack-option <on/off>
              option lightlid-35 <on/off>
              option toggle-lamp <on/off>
              option lineart-autoadjust <on/off>
              option backend-calibration <on/off>
              option colorbalance-adjust <on/off>

       option dump <n> enables printing of additional information
       about  the  SCSI  commands that are sent to the scanner to
       stderr. This option is primarily useful for debugging pur­
       pose.  This  option  has to be a global option and is best
       placed at the top of the microtek2.conf file.

       If n=1 the contents of the command blocks and the  results
       for  the  INQUIRY  and READ SCANNER ATTRIBUTES command are
       printed to stderr.

       If n=2 the contents of the command blocks  for  all  other
       SCSI  commands are printed to stderr, too. If n=3 the con­
       tents of the gamma table is printed, too. If n=4 all  scan
       data is additionally printed to stderr.

       The default is n=1.

       option  strip-height  <n>  , where <n> is a floating point
       number, limits the amount of data that is  read  from  the
       scanner  with  one read command.  The unit is inch and <n>
       defaults to 1.0, if this option is not set in the configu­
       ration  file.  If  less than <n> inch of data fit into the
       SCSI buffer, then the  smaller  value  is  used  and  this
       option has no effect.

       If  your system has a big SCSI buffer and you want to make
       use of the whole buffer, increase the value for  <n>.  For
       example,  if <n> is set to 14.0, no restrictions apply for
       scanners with a letter, legal or A4 sized scan area.


       The following options enable or disable  additional  fron­
       tend  options.  If an option is set to <on> an appropriate
       option will appear in the frontend.

       option no-backtrack-option <on/off> prevents  the  scanner
       head  from  moving  backwards  between  the read commands.
       This speeds up scanning. Try it.

       option lightlid-35 <on/off> If  you  use  the  LightLid-35
       transparency  adapter  you  get  an  advanced option which
       switches off the flatbed lamp during the scan.

       option toggle-lamp <on/off> You get a button in the  fron­
       tend where you can switch on and off the flatbed lamp.

       option  lineart-autoadjust <on/off> You can tell the back­
       end to try to determine  a  good  value  for  the  lineart
       threshold.

       option  backend-calibration  <on/off>  Some scanners (e.g.
       Phantom 330CX and 636CX) need to have calibrated the  data
       by  the  backend.  Try  this  option  if  you see vertical
       stripes in your pictures.

       option colorbalance-adjust <on/off>  Some  scanners  (e.g.
       Phantom  330CX and 636CX) need to have corrected the color
       balance. If  this  option  is  enabled  you  get  advanced
       options  where  you  can  balance the colors. And you will
       have a button to use the values that the firmware  of  the
       scanner provides.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              option dump 1
              option strip-height 1.0
              /dev/scanner
              option no-backtrack-option on
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge
              option lightlid-35 on

       This backend also supports the new configuration file for­
       mat which makes it easier to detect scanners under  Linux.
       If  you  have only one scanner it would be best to use the
       following configuration file for this backend:

              option dump 1
              option strip-height 14.0
              option no-backtrack-option on
              option backend-calibration on
              option lightlid-35 on
              option toggle-lamp on
              option lineart-autoadjust on
              option colorbalance-adjust off
              scsi * * Scanner

       In this case all SCSI-Scanners should be detected automat­
       ically because of the

       scsi * * Scanner

       line.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf
              The backend configuration file.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-microtek2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-microtek2.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 255
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity. To see error  messages  on
              stderr  set  SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2 to 1 (Remark: The
              whole debugging levels should be better revised).
              E.g. just say:
              export SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=128
