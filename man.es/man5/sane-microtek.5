NAME
       sane-microtek - SANE backend for Microtek scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-microtek  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the "sec­
       ond  generation"  Microtek scanners.  At present, the fol­
       lowing hardware is known to work with this backend:

              Microtek ScanMaker E2, E3, E6
              Microtek ScanMaker II, IIG, IIHR, IISP, III
              Microtek ScanMaker 35t, 35t+, 45t
              Microtek ScanMaker 600GS, 600ZS (see bug notes)
              Agfa StudioScan
              Agfa StudioScan II, StudioScan IIsi
              Agfa Arcus II (but not the "Arcus")
              Agfa DuoScan (premliminary)
              Vobis "Highscreen Realscan"
              Microtek Color PageWiz (preliminary)

              Transparent Media Adapter
              Document AutoFeeder

       The driver supports line art,  halftone,  8bpp  gray,  and
       24bpp  color  scans  at  normal and "expanded" resolutions
       (i.e. 1200x1200 on an E6), fast scans for color  previews,
       and downloadable gamma tables.

       The  supported  scanners  are all SCSI scanners.  However,
       some parallel port models may work (under Linux), if  they
       use a parport->scsi chip, and if you can find a scsi->par­
       port driver.  This is known to be the case for  the  Color
       PageWiz.

       The  driver does not support the newest Microtek scanners,
       such as the V330 and V660, which use a new and  very  dif­
       ferent  SCSI-II command set.  For those, try the alternate
       microtek2 backend.  Most non-SCSI scanners would  use  the
       new  command  set.  Most scanners newer than the Scanmaker
       E6 would use the new command set.

       If you own a Microtek scanner other than the  ones  listed
       above,  tell  us  what happens --- see the BUGS section at
       the end of this document.

       Although this manual page is generally updated  with  each
       release, up-to-date information on new releases and extra­
       neous helpful hints are available from the  backend  home­
       page:

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special device
       that corresponds to the scanner.  The special device  name
       must  be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symlink to such a
       device.  Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga
       or /dev/sge, for example.



CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the microtek.conf file is a list of device
       names that correspond to Microtek scanners.   Empty  lines
       and  lines  starting  with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A
       sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

       The configuration file may also contain the special tokens
       norealcal  or noprecal.  norealcal will disable the use of
       magic, undocumented scanner calibration commands which are
       known  to work on the E6, but may not work with other mod­
       els.  noprecal will disable logic  which  tries  to  avoid
       scanner  precalibration.   This logic would only have been
       activated if the magic calibration code was turned off.



FILES
       /etc/sane.d/microtek.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-microtek.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-microtek.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK
              If the library was compiled with debugging  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for  this  backend.   A  value  of  128
              requests  maximally  copious  debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Known bugs/limitations are:

              Brightness and contrast broken.
              The 600GS is grayscale only, and will  lock  up  if
              you  select  color.   (Unfortunately, the 600GS and
              600ZS are indistinguishable by software.)

       i.e. don't complain about  these  ---  but  if  brightness
       and/or contrast do work for you, please tell me.

       If  your  scanner  locks  up, try setting the norealcal or
       noprecal option in the configuration file (first one, then
       both), and see if it helps.  (If it does, report it.)

       Send  lengthy  bug  reports and new scanner information to
       mtek-bugs@mir.com.   All  bug  reports  and  new   scanner
       inquiries  should include an error log file.  You can gen­
       erate   copious   stderr    output    by    setting    the
       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK  environment variable described above.
       For example:

              setenv SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK 128
