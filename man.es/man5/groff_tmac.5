NAME
       groff_tmac - macro files in the roff typesetting system

DESCRIPTION
       The  roff(7)  type-setting  system provides a set of macro
       packages suitable for special kinds  of  documents.   Each
       macro  package stores its macros and definitions in a file
       called the package's tmac file.  The name is deduced  from
       `Troff MACros'.

       The  tmac  files  are normal roff source documents, except
       that they usually contain only definitions and setup  com­
       mands,  but  no text.  All tmac files are kept in a single
       or a small number of directories, the tmac directories.

NAMING
       In classical  roff  systems,  there  was  a  funny  naming
       scheme.   If  the name of a macro package started with `m'
       this letter was omitted, e.g., the macro package  for  the
       man  pages  man  was  called an and its macro file tmac.an
       (note that in recent versions of groff this file is called
       an.tmac instead).

       By  a similar reasoning, macro packages that did not start
       with an `m' were often referred to by adding an `m', e.g.,
       the  package  corresponding  to  tmac.doc  was called mdoc
       because the command-line for activating it reads

              troff -mdoc.

       Actual versions of groff(1) provide  both  naming  schemes
       for  the  inflicted  macro  packages, with and without the
       leading `m'. So in groff, the man  macro  package  may  be
       specified as

              groff -m man,
              groff -man,
              groff -mman, or
              groff -m an.

       The  easiest  way  to  find  out  which macro packages are
       available on a system is to check the contents of the tmac
       directories.   For example, a file called tmac.anything or
       anything.tmac determines a macro package named anything.

       In groff, most macro packages are described in  man  pages
       called groff_<name>(7), with a leading `m' for the classi­
       cal packages.

INCLUSION
       There are several ways to use a  macro  package  in  docu­
       ments.   At  run-time,  the groff option -m name makes the
       definitions in  the  macro  file  name.tmac  available  as
       described  in  the  section  NAMING.   If  this file isn't
       found, tmac.name will be searched.

       It is also possible to include the  macro  file  into  the
       document  by using the groff requests .so or .mso. For .so
       the full filename of the macro file must be  specified  --
       including  the  directory  where it is kept.  If the macro
       file is stored in one of the tmac directories it  is  more
       convenient  to  use  .mso  instead because it searches the
       tmac path for the filename.   Additionally,  if  the  file
       name  to  be  included has the form name.tmac and it isn't
       found, .mso will try to open tmac.name  instead  and  vice
       versa.

       Note  that  in  order to resolve the .so and .mso requests
       the roff preprocessor soelim must be called if  the  files
       to  be  included  needs  preprocessing.   This can be done
       either directly by a pipeline on the command  line  or  by
       using the -s option of groff.

       You  can  also  supply  the letter `s' in the preprocessor
       word as described in section CONVENTION.

       For  example,  suppose  a  macro   file   is   stored   as
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/macros.tmac  and  is  used in
       some document called docu.roff.

       At run-time, the formatter call for this is

              groff -m macros docu.roff

       To include the macro file directly in the document either
              .mso macros.tmac
       is used or
              .so /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/macros.tmac

       In both cases, the formatter is called with
              groff -s docu.roff

CONVENTION
       There is a convention that is  supported  by  many  modern
       roff  type-setters: the preprocessor word described in the
       following.

       If the first line in a document is a  comment,  the  first
       word  (after  the  comment characters and a blank) consti­
       tutes the preprocessor word.  That means that the  letters
       of  this  word  are interpreted as abbreviations for those
       preprocessor commands that should be run  when  formatting
       the  document.   Mostly, only the letters corresponding to
       the options for the  preprocessors  are  recognized,  `e',
       `G', `g', `p', `R', `s', and `t' (see roff(7)).

       Besides  being  a good reminder for the user, some format­
       ters (like the man(1) program) are even able to  automati­
       cally  start the preprocessors specified in the preproces­
       sor word, but do not bet on this.

WRITING A MACRO FILE
       Writing a groff macro file  is  easy.   Design  a  set  of
       macros,  strings,  registers, etc.  Store them in a single
       file.  Documents that use the macros  include  this  macro
       file  with  the  .so request as described in the INCLUSION
       section.

       To use the tmac functionality, call the macro  file  what­
       ever.tmac  (or tmac.whatever) and put it in some directory
       of the tmac path, cf. section FILES.  Then  documents  can
       include it with the .mso request or the groff -m option as
       described in the INCLUSION section.

       If your macros might be of general usage contact the groff
       maintainers  to  have  them  included in the groff contrib
       source directory.

       Some  general  guidelines  might  be  helpful  in  writing
       macros.

       · Double all functional backslashes, `\' -> `\\'.

       · All printable backslashes must be written as `\e'.

       · Escape all dots, `.' -> `\.'.

       · Make  ample  use  of the non-printable character `\&' in
         text parts, esp. before `\' and at the  beginning  of  a
         line, but not before a delayed command.

       · Use the character `@' in temporary variable names.

       · Test  your  macros for text and graphical devices, e.g.,
         latin1 and ps.

FILES
       All macro names must be named name.tmac  or  tmac.name  to
       use the tmac mechanism.

       The  macro  files are kept in the tmac directories, all of
       which constitute the tmac path.

       The elements of the search path for macro  files  are  (in
       that order):

       ·   the  directories  specified with troff's resp. groff's
           -M command line option

       ·   the directories given in the GROFF_TMAC_PATH  environ­
           ment variable

       ·   the  current  directory  (only if in unsafe mode using
           the -U command line switch)

       ·   the home directory

       ·   a site-specific  (platform-independent)  directory,  a
           platform-specific  directory, and the main tmac direc­
           tory:

             /usr/share/groff/site-tmac
             /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac
             /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TMAC_PATH
              A colon separated list of additional tmac  directo­
              ries  in  which to search for macro files.  See the
              previous section for a detailed description.

BUGS
       The groff documentation is in evolution at the moment.  It
       is  possible  that small inconsistencies between different
       documents exist temporarily.
