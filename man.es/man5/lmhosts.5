LMHOSTS(5)                                             LMHOSTS(5)



NAME
       lmhosts - The Samba NetBIOS hosts file

SYNOPSIS
       lmhosts  is  the   SambaNetBIOS name to IP address mapping
       file.

DESCRIPTION
       This file is part of the  Sambasuite.

       lmhosts is the Samba NetBIOS name to  IP  address  mapping
       file.  It  is  very similar to the /etc/hosts file format,
       except that the hostname component must correspond to  the
       NetBIOS naming format.

FILE FORMAT
       It  is an ASCII file containing one line for NetBIOS name.
       The two fields on each line are separated from each  other
       by  white  space. Any entry beginning with '#' is ignored.
       Each line in  the  lmhosts  file  contains  the  following
       information :

       · IP Address - in dotted decimal format.

       · NetBIOS  Name  -  This  name format is a maximum fifteen
         character host name, with an optional trailing '#' char­
         acter followed by the NetBIOS name type as two hexadeci­
         mal digits.

         If the trailing '#' is omitted then the given IP address
         will  be  returned  for  all  names that match the given
         name, whatever the NetBIOS name type in the lookup.

       An example follows :



       #
       # Sample Samba lmhosts file.
       #
       192.9.200.1    TESTPC
       192.9.200.20   NTSERVER#20
       192.9.200.21   SAMBASERVER




       Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings. The first  and
       third  will  be  returned  for  any  queries for the names
       "TESTPC" and "SAMBASERVER" respectively, whatever the type
       component of the NetBIOS name requested.


       The  second  mapping will be returned only when the "0x20"
       name type for a name "NTSERVER" is queried. Any other name
       type will not be resolved.


       The  default  location  of the lmhosts file is in the same
       directory as the smb.conf(5)>file.

AUTHOR
       The  original  Samba  software  and related utilities were
       created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by  the
       Samba  Team  as  an Open Source project similar to the way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written  by  Karl  Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another excellent piece of Open Source  software,  avail­
       able           at          ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba  2.0  release  by  Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
