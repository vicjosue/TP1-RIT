NAME
       sane-dc25  - SANE backend for Kodak DC20/DC25 Digital Cam­
       eras

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-dc25 library implements a  SANE  (Scanner  Access
       Now  Easy)  backend that provides access to Kodak DC20 and
       DC25 cameras.  At present, only the DC25 has been  tested,
       but  since  the code is based on a DC20 interface program,
       it is likely to work for that model also.

DEVICE NAMES
       The current version of the backend only allows one  camera
       to be connected.  The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents of the dc25.conf specify the serial port and
       baud rate to use.  The baud  rate  specifies  the  maximum
       rate  to  use  while downloading pictures.  (The camera is
       always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches  to  the
       higher  rate).   On  my  90MHz  Pentium, I usually have no
       problems downloading at 115200 baud as long as the  system
       is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask flag" is
       set in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1).  Supported baud  rates
       are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some information about the
       camera to be printed  to  stderr  during  startup.   Note:
       This  is not compatible with saned, so make sure you don't
       have any dumpinquiry lines if you are  using  saned  (i.e.
       scanning on a remote machine using a network).

       Empty  lines  and  lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
       ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc25.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc25.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc25.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC25
              If the library was compiled with debugging  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for  this  backend.   A  value  of  128
              requests  maximally  copious  debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Known bugs/limitations are:

       I haven't figured out how to trigger an option reload fol­
       lowing  a "scan."  This causes problems when a new picture
       is snapped for example, the slider that is used to  select
       the  picture  from  the  camera may not be updated immedi­
       ately.

       More general comments, suggestions,  and  inquiries  about
       frontends or SANE should go to the SANE Developers mailing
       list   (see   http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html    for
       details).   You  must be subscribed to the list, otherwise
       your mail won't be sent to the subscribers.
