LDIF(5)                                                   LDIF(5)



NAME
       ldif - LDAP Data Interchange Format

DESCRIPTION
       The  LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to repre­
       sent LDAP entries in text form. LDAP tools, such  as  lda­
       padd(1) and ldapsearch(1), read and write LDIF.

       The basic form of an LDIF entry is:

            dn: <distinguished name>
            <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
            <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
            <attrdesc>:: <base64-encoded-value>
            <attrdesc>:< <URL>
            ...

       The  value  may  be  specified  as UTF-8 text or as base64
       encoded data, or a URI may be provided to the location  of
       the attribute value.

       A  line  may be continued by starting the next line with a
       single space or tab, e.g.,

            dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen, dc=exam
             ple, dc=com

       Lines beginning with a sharpe sign ('#') are ignored.

       Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines,
       e.g.,

            cn: Barbara J Jensen
            cn: Babs Jensen

       If  an  value contains a non-printing character, or begins
       with a space or a colon ':', the <attrtype> is followed by
       a  double  colon and the value is encoded in base 64 nota­
       tion. e.g., the value " begins  with  a  space"  would  be
       encoded like this:

            cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=

       If  the  attribute  value is located in a file, the <attr­
       type> is followed by a ':<' and a file:  URI.   e.g.,  the
       value  contained  in  the  file /tmp/value would be listed
       like this:

            cn:< file:///tmp/value
       Other URI schemes (ftp,http) may be supported as well.

       Multiple entries within the same LDIF file  are  separated
       by blank lines.

EXAMPLE
       Here  is  an  example  of  an  LDIF  file containing three
       entries.

            dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen, dc=example, dc=com
            cn: Barbara J Jensen
            cn: Babs Jensen
            objectclass: person
            description:< file://tmp/babs
            sn: Jensen

            dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen, dc=example, dc=com
            cn: Bjorn J Jensen
            cn: Bjorn Jensen
            objectclass: person
            sn: Jensen

            dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen, dc=example, dc=com
            cn: Jennifer J Jensen
            cn: Jennifer Jensen
            objectclass: person
            sn: Jensen
            jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD
             A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ
             ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG
            ...

       Notice that the description in Barbara Jensen's  entry  is
       read  from  file://tmp/babs  and the jpegPhoto in Jennifer
       Jensen's entry is encoded using base 64.
