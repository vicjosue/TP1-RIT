NAME
       sane-coolscan - SANE backend for Nikon film-scanners


ABOUT THIS FILE
       This  file  is  a short descripton of the coolscan-backend
       for sane!


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-coolscan library implements a SANE  backend  that
       provides  the  interface  to  the following Nikon Coolscan
       Film scanners: Nikon LS20, LS30, LS1000, LS2000.

       Even though the backend has worked for a number of people,
       there  are  still some problems, especially in combination
       with some SCSI card/drivers (AHA-1505/aha152x.o)  and  the
       autofocus   command.  You  should  consider  this  backend
       'alpha' and be carefull when using it the first time.


CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  file  for  this  backend  resides   in
       /etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf.

       Its  contents is a list of device names that correspond to
       Nikon Coolscan scanners. Empty lines  and  lines  starting
       with  a  hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration
       file is shown below:

        #scsi Vendor Model Type
        scsi Nikon * Scanner
        /dev/scanner

       The special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
       symlink  to  such  a  device.  To find out to which device
       your scanner is assigned and how you have to set the  per­
       missions of that device, have a look at sane-scsi.


SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
       Some  SCSI-adapters and low-level SCSI drivers do not work
       correctly with this backend  and  the  Coolscan  scanners.
       These  systems  hang when the autofocus command is send to
       the Scanner.  To see a list of which card/driver  combina­
       tions    work    or    dont   work   have   a   look   at:

FILES
       The backend configuration file:
        /etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf.

       The static library implementing this backend:
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-coolscan.a

       The shared library implementing this backend:
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-coolscan.so
        (present on systems that support dynamic loading)


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN
        If the library was compiled with debug  support  enabled,
       this  environment  variable  controls  the debug level for
       this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug out­
       put  to  be  printed.  Smaller  levels  reduce  verbosity:
       SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN values

       Examples:
        on bash:
        export SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN=8
        on csh
        setenv SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN 8


BUGS
        The autofocus  command  does  not  work  with  some  SCSI
       card/driver combinations
        The gamma table is not implemented for the LS1000 yet.
        The dust-removal is not working yet

THANKS TO
        Didier  Carlier - For writing the original Coolscan back­
       end (without it I would not have started this)
        Oliver.Rauch - For  adapting  xsane  so  quickly  to  the
       infrared stuff.
