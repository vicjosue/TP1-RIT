NAME
       sane-epson - SANE backend for EPSON scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-epson  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access  to  Epson  flatbed
       scanners.   Some  functions of this backend should be con­
       sidered beta-quality software! Most  functions  have  been
       stable  for a long time, but of course new development can
       not and will not function properly  from  the  very  first
       day.  Please report any strange behavior to the maintainer
       of the backend.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work  with
       this backend:

       For  other  scanners  the  software   may or may not work.
       Please send mail to the backend  author  (khk@khk.net)  to
       report successes or failures.

OPTIONS
       The  options  the  backend supports can either be selected
       through command line options to programs like scanimage or
       through GUI elements in xscanimage or xsane.

       Valid  command line options and their syntax can be listed
       by using
              scanimage --help -d epson
       Not all devices support all options.

       Scan Mode
              The --mode switch selects the basic mode of  opera­
              tion  of the scanner valid choices are Binary, Gray
              and Color.  The Binary  mode  is  black  and  white
              only,  Gray will produce 256 levels of gray or more
              depending on the scanner and  Color  means  24  bit
              color  mode or more depending on the scanner.  Some
              scanners will internally  use  36  bit  color,  the
              external  interface  however  does  only support 24
              bits.

              The --depth option selects the bit depth the  scan­
              ner  is  using.  This  option is only available for
              scanners that support  more  than  one  bit  depth.
              Older  scanners  will  always transfer the image in
              8bit mode. Newer scanners allow to select either  8
              bits  or  12  or  14  bits per color channel. For a
              color scan this means an effective color  depth  of
              36  or  42 bits over all channels. The valid choice
              depend on the scanner model.

              The --dropout option determines which color filters
              are  used to scan in Binary mode. Valid choices are
              None, Red, Green and Blue.

              The --halftoning switch selects the  mode  that  is
              used  in  Binary  mode.  Valid  options  are  None,
              Halftone A (Hard Tone),  Halftone  B  (Soft  Tone),
              Halftone  C  (Net  Screen),  Dither  A (4x4 Bayer),
              Dither B (4x4 Spiral), Dither C (4x4  Net  Screen),
              Dither  D  (8x4 Net Screen), Text Enhanced Technol­
              ogy, Download pattern A, and Download pattern B.

              The --dropout switch selects the so called  dropout
              color.  Vald options are None, Red, Green and Blue.
              The default is None. The dropout color is used  for
              monochrome  scanning  and selects the color that is
              not scanned. This can be used to e.g. scan an orig­
              inal with a colored background.

              The  --brightness switch controls the brightness of
              the scan. Valid options are the numbers from -3  to
              3.  The  default  is  0.  The larger the brightness
              value, the brighter  the  image  gets.  If  a  user
              defined table for the gamma correction is selected,
              the brightness parameter is not available.

              The --sharpness switch sets the  sharpness  of  the
              image  data.  Valid options are the numbers from -2
              to  2,  with  -2  meaning  "Defocus",  -1  "Defocus
              slightly",  0  "Normal",  1 "Sharpen slighly" and 2
              "Sharpen".

              The --gamma-correction switch controls  the  scanne
              internal   gamma   correction.  Valid  options  are
              "Default", "User defined", "High density  printing"
              "Low  density  printing"  and "High contrast print­
              ing".

              The --color-correction switch controls the  scanner
              internal  color  correction function. Valid options
              are "No Correction", "Impact-dot printers",  "Ther­
              mal  printers",  "Ink-jet  printers" and "CRT moni­
              tors". The default is "CRT monitors".

              The --resolution switch selects the resolution  for
              a  scan. Many EPSON scanners will scan in any resu­
              lution between  the  lowest  and  highest  possible
              value. The list reported by the scanner can be dis­
              played using the "--help -d  epson"  parameters  to
              scanimage.

              The  --mirror  option controls the way the image is
              scanned. By reading the image data  from  right  to
              left  the image is mirored. Valid options are "yes"
              and "no". The default is "no".

              The --speed option can improve the  scan  speed  in
              monochrome  mode.  Valid options are "yes" or "no",
              the "yes" option will speed up  the  scan  if  this
              option is supported.

              The  --auto-area-segmentation  switch  turns on the
              automatic area segmentation for  monochrome  scans.
              The  scanner  will try to determine which areas are
              text and which contain images. The image areas will
              be  halftoned,  and the text will be impoved. Valid
              options are "yes" and "no". The default is "yes".

              The --gamma-table parameter can be used to download
              a  user  defined gamma table. The options takes 256
              values from the range 0-255.  In  color  mode  this
              option  equally  affects  the  red, green, and blue
              channel.

              The --red-gamma-table  parameter  can  be  used  to
              download  a  user  defined  gamma table for the red
              channel. The valid options  are  the  same  as  for
              --gamma-table.

              The  --green-gamma-table  parameter  can be used to
              download a user defined gamma table for  the  green
              channel.  The  valid  options  are  the same as for
              --gamma-table.

              The --blue-gamma-table parameter  can  be  used  to
              download  a  user  defined gamma table for the blue
              channel. The valid options  are  the  same  as  for
              --gamma-table.

              The  color  correction coefficients --cct-1 --cct-2
              --cct-3 ... --cct-9 will install  color  correction
              coefficients for the user defined color correction.
              Possible values are in the range -127..127.


              The --preview option requests a preview  scan.  The
              frontend software automatically selects a low reso­
              lution. Valid  options  are  "yes"  and  "no".  The
              default is "no".

              The  --preview-speed options will increase the scan
              speed if this is supported by  the  scanner.  Valid
              options are "yes" and "no", the default is "no".


              The  geometry  options -l -t -x -y control the scan
              area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the top
              left  y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the
              height of the scan aea. All parameters  are  speci­
              fied in milimeters.

              The  --quick-format  option  lets the user select a
              scan area with predefined sizes.  Valid  parameters
              are  "CD", "A5 portrait", "A5 landscape", "Letter",
              "A4" and "max". The default is "max", which selects
              the largest possible area.

              The  --source option selects the scan source. Valid
              options  depend  on  the  installed  options.   The
              default is "Flatbed".

              The  --auto-eject  option  will  eject a page after
              scanning from the document feeder.

              The --film-type option will select  the  film  type
              for  scans  with the transparency unit. This option
              is only activated of the TPU is  selected  as  scan
              source. Valid options are "Negative Film" and "Pos­
              itive Film".

              The --focus-position option selects the focus posi­
              tion  for all scans. Valid options are "Focus 2.5mm
              above glass" and "Focus on glass". The focus on the
              2.5mm  point above the glass is necessary for scans
              with the transparency unit, so that the scanner can
              focus  on  the  film  if one of the film holders is
              used.




CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration  file  /etc/sane.d/epson.conf  specifies
       the  device(s) that the backend will use. The current ver­
       sion only supports one scanner per Epson backend. Possible
       connection types are:

       SCSI   This  is the default, and if nothing else is speci­
              fied the backend software will open a  given  patch
              as SCSI device. More information about valid syntax
              for SCSI devices can be found in sane-scsi(5).

       PIP - Parallel Interface
              The parallel interface can  be  configured  in  two
              ways:  An  integer number starting at the beginning
              of a line will be interpreted as the IO address  of
              the  parallel  port. To make it clearer that a con­
              figured IO address is  a  parallel  port  the  port
              address  can  be  preceded by the string "PIO". The
              PIO connection does not use a special  device  file
              in the /dev directory.

       USB    A  device file that is preceded by the string "USB"
              is treated as a scanner connected via the Universal
              Serial  Bus. The correct special device file has to
              be created prior to using it with Sane. See the USB
              documentation for more information about how to set
              up the USB subsystem and the required device files.

FILES
       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-epson.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-epson.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_EPSON
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


       SANE_EPSON_CMD_LVL
              This allows to override  the  function  or  command
              level that the backend uses to communicate with the
              scanner. The function level a scanner  supports  is
              determined during the initialization of the device.
              If the backend  does  not  recognize  the  function
              level  reported  by  the scanner it will default to
              function level B5. Valid function  levels  are  A1,
              A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8 and F5. Use this
              feature only if you know what you are doing!

BUGS
       None :-) At least none are currently known.


UNSUPPORTED DEVICES
       The backend may be used with Epson scanners that  are  not
       yet  listed under the list of supported devices. A scanner
       that is not recognized may default to the  function  level
       B3,  which  means  that not all functions that the scanner
       may be capable of are accessible.

       If the scanner is not even recognized as an Epson  scanner
       this  is  probably because the device name reported by the
       scanner is not in the correct  format.  Please  send  this
       information to the backend maintainer (email address is in
       the AUTHOR section of this man page or in the AUTHORS file
       of the SANE distribution).
