NAME
       sane-st400  - SANE backend for Siemens ST/Highscan flatbed
       scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-st400 library implements a SANE  (Scanner  Access
       Now  Easy)  backend  that provides access to Siemens ST400
       flatbed scanners and compatibles.  At present, the follow­
       ing scanners are supported by this backend:

              Siemens ST400 (6 bit gray scale)
              Siemens ST800 (6 bit gray scale)

       The driver supports line art and gray scans up to 8bpp.

       The  Siemens ST/Highscan series includes several more mod­
       els, e.g. the ST300 and ST600.  If you own  one  of  these
       scanners,  or  a  scanner other than the ones listed above
       that works with this backend, please let us know by  send­
       ing  the scanner's model name, SCSI ID, and firmware revi­
       sion  to   sane-devel@mostang.com.    Have   a   look   at
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html concerning subscrip­
       tion to sane-devel.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is either  the  path-name  for  the  special
       device  that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scan­
       ners, the special device  name  must  be  a  generic  SCSI
       device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a
       device name could be /dev/sga or  /dev/sge,  for  example.
       See sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the st400.conf file is a list of device
       names that correspond to Siemens  scanners.   Empty  lines
       and  lines  starting  with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A
       sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

       The default configuration file that  is  distributed  with
       SANE looks like this:

              scsi SIEMENS "ST 400" Scanner * * 3 0

       In  this  configuration,  the  driver  can only access the
       ST400 model at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0 (see section  "BUGS"  below
       for  the  reason).   To  use the driver with other scanner
       models, add an appropriate line to the configuration file.
       For  example,  to use it with an ST800 at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0,
       add the line:

              scsi SIEMENS "ST 800" Scanner * * 3 0


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/st400.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-st400.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-st400.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_ST400
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of  128
              requests  all  debug  output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       Everything but the most basic stuff.


BUGS
       Currently, the backend does  not  check  if  the  attached
       device  really  is a ST400.  It will happily accept every­
       thing that matches the configuration entries.  This  makes
       it  easy to test the backend with other scanners: Just add
       an appropriate line to the configuration file.   The  con­
       figuration file as distributed (see above) only works with
       the ST400.  Be careful: If there is no config file at all,
       the backend defaults to /dev/scanner.

       The  ST400  answers on all eight SCSI LUNs.  Normally this
       is not a problem, as LUN support is  usually  disabled  in
       SCSI  drivers, but if you are seeing multiple instances of
       the scanner in a device list, either disable LUNs in  your
       SCSI  setup  or change the entry in the configuration file
       to match LUN 0 only.


DEBUG
       If you encounter a bug please set the environment variable
       SANE_DEBUG_ST400 to 128 and try to regenerate the problem.
       Then send me a report with the log attached.

       If you encounter  a  SCSI  bus  error  or  trimmed  and/or
       displaced  images please also set the environment variable
       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 before sending me the report.
