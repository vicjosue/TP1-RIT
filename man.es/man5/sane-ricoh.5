NAME
       sane-ricoh - SANE backend for Ricoh flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-ricoh  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access  to  the  following
       Ricoh flatbed scanners:

              IS50
              IS60


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to a SCSI scanner.  The  special  device  name
       must  be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symlink to such a
       device.  The program sane-find-scanner helps to  find  out
       the  correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could
       be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for  example.   See  sane-scsi(5)
       for details.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/ricoh.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-ricoh.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-ricoh.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_RICOH
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level for this backend.  Higher debug levels
              increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_RICOH=4
