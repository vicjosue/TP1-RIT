NAME
       sane-agfafocus - SANE backend for AGFA Focus flatbed scan­
       ners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-agfafocus  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now  Easy)  backend  that  provides access to AGFA
       Focus flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners
       are supported from this backend:

              AGFA Focus GS Scanner (6 bit gray scale) (untested)
              AGFA Focus Lineart Scanner (lineart) (untested)
              AGFA Focus II (8 bit gray scale) (untested)
              AGFA Focus Color (24 bit color 3-pass)
              AGFA Focus Color Plus (24 bit color 3-pass)

              Siemens S9036 (8 bit gray scale) (untested)

       The driver supports line art, 6bpp and  8bpp  gray,  18bpp
       and 24bpp color scans.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above that
       works with this backend, please let us know by sending the
       scanner's  model  name,  SCSI id, and firmware revision to
       sane-devel@mostang.com.      Have      a      look      at
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html concerning subscrip­
       tion to sane-devel.

       All of these scanners are  pre-SCSI-2,  and  do  not  even
       report  properly  to SCSI Inquiry.  This is typically evi­
       dent in SCSI bus scans, where the  scanner  will  come  up
       with only garbage as vendor and models strings.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special  is  either  the  path-name for the special
       device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI  scan­
       ners,  the  special  device  name  must  be a generic SCSI
       device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a
       device  name  could  be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example.
       See sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the  agfafocus.conf  file  is  a  list  of
       device  names  that  correspond  to  AGFA  Focus scanners.
       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge



FILES
       /etc/sane.d/agfafocus.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128
              requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.  SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS val­
              ues:


              Number  Remark

               0       print important errors (printed each time)
               1       print errors
               2       print sense
               3       print warnings
               4       print scanner-inquiry
               5       print informations
               6       print less important informations
               7       print called procedures
               8       print reader_process messages
               10      print called sane-init-routines
               11      print called sane-procedures
               12      print sane infos
               13      print sane option-control messages


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       Uploading of  dither  matrices  and  tonecurves  has  been
       implemented,  but  so  far has not proven to be useful for
       anything.  For this reason these options  have  been  dis­
       abled.


BUGS
       The  scanners that do not support disconnect have problems
       with SCSI timeouts if the SCSI bus gets loaded, eg. if you
       do a kernel build at the same time as scanning.  To see if
       your scanner supports disconnect, run  "SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFO­
       CUS=128 scanimage -L" in sh and look for the "disconnect:"
       line)


DEBUG
       If you have problems with SANE not detecting your scanner,
       make  sure  the  Artec backend is disabled.  Somehow, this
       backend causes at least my scanner  not  to  respond  cor­
       rectly to SCSI inquiry commands.

       If you encounter a bug please set the environment variable
       SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS to 128  and  try  to  regenerate  the
       problem. Then send me a report with the log attached.

       If  you  encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or dis­
       placed images please also  set  the  environment  variable
       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 before sending me the report.


TODO
       More scanners?

              The AGFA ACS and ARCUS scanners are similar to  the
              FOCUS  scanners.   The  driver  could  probably  be
              extended to support these scanners without too many
              changes.   I  do  not have access to such scanners,
              and cannot add support for it.  However, if you are
              in possession of such a scanner, I could be helpful
              in adding support for these scanners.

              The AGFA HORIZON scanners are SCSI-2 scanners,  and
              it  would probably be easier to support these scan­
              ners in a SCSI-2 compliant backend.
