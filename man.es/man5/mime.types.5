NAME
       mime.types - mime type description file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.types file defines the recognized file types.

       Additional  file  types  can  be added to mime.types or in
       additional files in the configuration directory  /etc/cups
       with the extension ".types".

       Each  line  in the mime.types file is a comment, blank, or
       rule line. Comment lines start with the # character.  Rule
       lines  start  with  the  MIME type name and are optionally
       followed by a series of file recognition  rules  that  are
       used to automatically identify print and web files:

           super/type rule [ ... ruleN]
       The  rules  may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using
       "+" for a logical AND and "," or whitespace for a  logical
       OR, and negated using "!".

RULES
       Rules  take two forms - a filename extension by itself and
       functions with test values inside parenthesis. The follow­
       ing functions are available:

       match("pattern")
            Pattern match on filename

       ascii(offset,length)
            True if bytes are valid printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB,
            BS, 32-126)

       printable(offset,length)
            True if bytes are printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB,
            BS, 32-126, 128-254)

       string(offset,"string")
            True if bytes are identical to string

       char(offset,value)
            True if byte is identical

       short(offset,value)
            True if 16-bit integer is identical

       int(offset,value)
            True if 32-bit integer is identical

       locale("string")
            True if current locale matches string

       contains(offset,range,"string")
            True if the range contains the string

STRING CONSTANTS
       String  constants  can be specified inside quotes ("") for
       strings containing whitespace and angle brackets (<>)  for
       hexadecimal strings.
