NAME
       ypserv.conf - configuration file for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd

DESCRIPTION
       ypserv.conf is an ASCII file which contains  some  options
       for  ypserv.  It also contains a list of rules for special
       host and map access for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd.  This  file
       will  be read by ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd at startup, or when
       receiving a SIGHUP signal.

       There is one entry per line. If the line is a option line,
       the format is:

              option: [yes|no]

       The line for an access rule has the format:

              host:map:security:mangle[:field]

       All  rules  are  tried  one  by one. If no match is found,
       access to a map is allowed.

       Following options exist:

       dns    the NIS server will query the nameserver for  host­
              names, which are not found in the hosts.* maps. The
              default is "no". You could overwrite  it  with  the
              "-dns"  commandline  option.  A "no" will not over­
              write the "-dns" option.

       sunos_kludge
              This is not longer supported, since ypserv supports
              the most YP version 1 functions.

       xfr_check_port
              With  this  option  enabled,  the NIS master server
              have to run on a port < 1024. The default is  "yes"
              (enabled).

       The field descriptions for the access rule lines are:

       host   IP address. Wildcards are allowed.
              Examples:
              131.234. = 131.234.0.0/255.255.0.0
              131.234.214.0/255.255.254.0

       map    name of the map, or asterisk for all maps.

       security
              one of none, port, deny, des:

       none   always  allow access. Mangle the passwd field if so
              configured, default is not.

       port   allow access if from port < 1024. Otherwise if man­
              gle  is  not set, do not allow access. If mangle is
              set to "yes", allow access, but mangle  the  passwd
              field.

       deny   deny access to this map.

       des    requires  DES authentication. Not supported by most
              libc's in the moment.  You could mangle the  passwd
              field if so configured, default is not.

       mangle possible  values  are  "yes" or "no". If "yes", the
              field entry will be mangled.  Mangling  means  that
              the  field  is  replaced  by  'x' if the port check
              reveals  the  request  originated   from   somebody
              unprivileged.

       field  Which  field  should be mangled. The default is the
              2nd field.

WARNINGS
       The access rules for special maps are no real  improvement
       in  security,  but  they make the life a little bit harder
       for a potential hacker.

BUGS
       Solaris clients don't use privileged ports.  All  security
       options  which  depend on privileged ports cause big prob­
       lems on Solaris clients.
