NAME
       sane-m3096g,   sane-sp15c  -  SANE  backends  for  Fujitsu
       flatbed scanners


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-m3096g and sane-sp15c  libraries  implement  SANE
       (Scanner Access Now Easy) backends which provide access to
       Fujitsu flatbed scanners.  At present, the following scan­
       ners are known to work with these backends:

              Vendor:  Model:           Rev:
              -------- ---------------- -----
              FUJITSU  M3096Gm          02
              FCPA     ScanPartner 15C  1.01

       The  M3096G  driver  supports  lineart  (1-bit),  halftone
       (1-bit), and grayscale (8-bit) scanning.

       The  ScanPartner  15C  driver  supports  lineart  (1-bit),
       halftone  (1-bit),  grayscale (4-bit and 8-bit), and color
       (3 x 8-bit) scanning.

       Other scanners in these families may work.  The  ScanPart­
       ner 15C seems to be a repackaging of the ScanPartner 600C.
       Perusal of the M3096GX/M3093GX/M3093DG manual suggests the
       M3096G  driver  offers access to a subset of the new scan­
       ners.  People are encouraged to try these driver with  the
       other  scanners  and  to  contact  the  author  with  test
       results.


CONFIGURATION
       A modest effort has  been  made  to  expose  the  standard
       options  to the API.  This allows frontends such as xscan­
       image to set scanning region, resolution,  bit-depth  (and
       color), and enable the automatic document feeder.

LIMITATIONS
       Testing limited to a Linux 2.2.5 kernel
       Can't quite get the scan page/minute  performance  in  ADF
       modes.  This may be due to limited system buffer size.


BUGS
       I'm  sure there are plenty, and not too well hidden, but I
       haven't seen them yet.
       Both scanners claim to have separate control of resolution
       in  X  and  Y directions.  I confess I haven't tested this
       yet.  I have found that xsane doesn't  even  display  this
       capability.
       Threshold  settings  on the SP15C don't seem to affect the
       results of lineart mode scans.
       It might be possible to merge these  two  drivers  without
       much  effort  since  the SP15C driver was derived from the
       M3096G driver.  They were split so as to keep  the  second
       driver development from breaking the working first driver.
       Watch this space for changes.
