NAME
       mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.convs file defines the filters that are available
       for converting files from one format to another. The stan­
       dard  filters  support text, PDF, PostScript, HP-GL/2, and
       many types of image files.

       Additional filters can be added to the mime.convs file  or
       to  other files in the configuration directory (/etc/cups)
       with the extension ".convs".

       Each line in the mime.types file is a comment,  blank,  or
       filter  line.  Comment  lines  start with the # character.
       Filter lines specify the source and destination MIME types
       along  with a relative cost associated with the filter and
       the filter to run:

       super/type super/type cost filter
       application/postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
