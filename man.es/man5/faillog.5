NAME
       faillog - Login failure logging file

DESCRIPTION
       faillog maintains a count of login failures and the limits
       for each  account.   The  file  is  fixed  length  record,
       indexed  by numerical UID.  Each record contains the count
       of login failures since the  last  successful  login;  the
       maximum number of failures before the account is disabled;
       the line the last login failure occured on; and  the  date
       the last login failure occured.

       The structure of the file is

               struct faillog {
                       short   fail_cnt;
                       short   fail_max;
                       char    fail_line[12];
                       time_t  fail_time;
               };
