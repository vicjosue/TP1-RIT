NAME
       sane-sm3600  - SANE backend for Microtek scanners M011 USB
       chip

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-sm3600 library implements a SANE (Scanner  Access
       Now  Easy)  backend  that provides access to some Microtek
       scanners with the Toshiba  M011  custom  USB  chip.   This
       backend should be considered alpha.

       There  exist  a  backends  for Microtek scanners with SCSI
       command  set.   Refer  to   sane-microtek(5)   and   sane-
       microtek2(5) for details.

       At present, the following scanners are known positively to
       work with this backend:

              Vendor     Product id:     Remark:
              --------   --------------  -----------
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3600  all modes ok

       If you own a Microtek scanner with  the  M011  chip  other
       than  the  ones  listed above, it may or may not work with
       SANE!


FRONTEND OPTIONS
       This backend dynamically enables the options for the fron­
       tend,  that  are supported by the scanner in dependence of
       the scanning-mode and other options. Not supported options
       are disabled.

       The    following    options    are    supported   by   the
       Microtek2-driver:

       Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.

       contrast, brightness, control, gamma correction.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend does not support device  names  in  a  usable
       form.


CONFIGURATION
       This  backend  does not support a configuration file right
       now.


FILES
       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-sm3600.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-sm3600.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SM3600
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels  reduce  verbosity. To see error messages on
              stderr set SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 to 1.

              E.g. just say:
              export SANE_DEBUG_SM3600=5
