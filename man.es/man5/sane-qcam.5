NAME
       sane-qcam - SANE backend for Connectix QuickCam cameras

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-qcam  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access Connectix  QuickCam
       cameras.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port

       Where  port  is  the  I/O port address at which the device
       resides.  This address is normally specified in  hexadeci­
       mal  using C syntax (e.g., 0x37b) and may be prefixed with
       the letter "u" (e.g., u0x37b)  to  force  the  backend  to
       access the camera in uni-directional mode.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the  qcam.conf  file  is  a  list  port
       addresses that may be connected to a  Connectix  QuickCam.
       Empty  lines  and everything starting from a hash mark (#)
       up to the end of a line are ignored.  A sample  configura­
       tion file is shown below:

              0x37b  # /dev/lp0
              0x378  # /dev/lp1
              u0x278 # /dev/lp2 forced in uni-directional mode
              0x3bc  # /dev/lp0 (alternate address)

       In  general,  it is safest to list only the port addresses
       that really correspond to a QuickCam.  For example, if one
       of  the  listed  addresses  actually connect to a printer,
       then starting up this backend will cause  the  printer  to
       perform a device reset (which is generally undesirable).

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/qcam.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-qcam.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-qcam.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched    after    the    explicitly    specified
              directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              to   "/tmp/config:"  would  result  in  directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_QCAM
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Support  is  currently limited to the color version of the
       QuickCam.  The black-and-white camera is starting to  work
       too,  but  I  don't  believe  it  works  in all cases yet.
       Reportedly, acquiring images of certain sizes  work  fine,
       but others result in shifted images (sounds like a problem
       due to byte-padding).

       The program needs root-priviledges since it  needs  to  be
       able to access the camera's I/O ports.
