SYSCTL.CONF(5)                                     SYSCTL.CONF(5)



NAME
       sysctl.conf - sysctl(8) preload/configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       sysctl.conf  is  a simple file containing sysctl values to
       be read in and set by sysctl(8).  The syntax is simply  as
       follows:

              # comment
              ; comment

                token  =   value


       Note  that  blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before
       and after a token or value is ignored,  although  a  value
       can contain whitespace within.  Lines which begin with a #
       or ; are considered comments and ignored.

EXAMPLE
              # sysctl.conf sample
              #

                kernel.domainname = example.com
              ; this one has a space which will be written to the sysctl!
                kernel.modprobe = /sbin/mod probe
