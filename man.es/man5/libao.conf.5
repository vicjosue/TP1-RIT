NAME
       libao.conf - configuration for libao.


SYNOPSIS
       /etc/libao.conf

       ~/.libao


DESCRIPTION
       libao.conf  and  .libao are configuration files for libao,
       the audio output library.  They specify various options to
       libao,  as  described  below.  libao.conf sets system-wide
       options,  whereas  ~/.libao  sets  user-specific  options.
       When  an  option  is  set  in  both  places, the option in
       ~/.libao takes precedence.


FILE FORMAT
       The file consists of comments and key-value  pairs.   Com­
       ments  are  on  separate lines that start with a # symbol.
       The key-value pairs are of the form:
               key=value
       where key contains  no  whitespace  and  no  equal  signs.
       value  will  be all of the text after the equal sign until
       (but not including) the ending newline.  Beware  of  extra
       spaces  at  the  end  of  the line!  They will probably be
       interpreted as part of the option value.

       Valid option keys are:

              default_driver
                     The short name of the  driver  libao  should
                     use by default.


EXAMPLE
       Here  is  an example libao.conf that forces the OSS driver
       to be used by default:

           # This is a comment.
           default_driver=oss


BUGS
       libao.conf is  missing  a  number  of  potentially  useful
       options.
