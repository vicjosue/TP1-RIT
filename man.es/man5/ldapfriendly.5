LDAPFRIENDLY(5)                                   LDAPFRIENDLY(5)



NAME
       ldapfriendly - data file for LDAP friendly routines

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/share/openldap/ldapfriendly

DESCRIPTION
       The  file /usr/share/openldap/ldapfriendly contains simple
       mapping information used by the ldap_friendly_name(3) rou­
       tine.   Blank  lines and lines that have a first character
       of `#' are treated as comments and ignored.  The  informa­
       tion  consists of lines that contain an "unfriendly" name,
       a tab, and a "friendly" name.

       Other friendly mapping files can be created  and  used  by
       ldap_friendly_name(3).   Just  use the same format as that
       described  above  and  include  the  file  name   in   the
       ldap_friendly_name() call.
