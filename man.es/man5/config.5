       config - OpenSSL CONF library configuration files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The OpenSSL CONF library can be used to read configuration
       files.  It is used for the OpenSSL master configuration
       file ooppeennssssll..ccnnff and in a few other places like SSPPKKAACC
       files and certificate extension files for the xx550099
       utility.

       A configuration file is divided into a number of sections.
       Each section starts with a line [[ sseeccttiioonn_nnaammee ]] and ends
       when a new section is started or end of file is reached. A
       section name can consist of alphanumeric characters and
       underscores.

       The first section of a configuration file is special and
       is referred to as the ddeeffaauulltt section this is usually
       unnamed and is from the start of file until the first
       named section. When a name is being looked up it is first
       looked up in a named section (if any) and then the default
       section.

       The environment is mapped onto a section called EENNVV.

       Comments can be included by preceding them with the ##
       character

       Each section in a configuration file consists of a number
       of name and value pairs of the form nnaammee==vvaalluuee

       The nnaammee string can contain any alphanumeric characters as
       well as a few punctuation symbols such as .. ,, ;; and _.

       The vvaalluuee string consists of the string following the ==
       character until end of line with any leading and trailing
       white space removed.

       The value string undergoes variable expansion. This can be
       done by including the form $$vvaarr or $${{vvaarr}}: this will
       substitute the value of the named variable in the current
       section. It is also possible to substitute a value from
       another section using the syntax $$sseeccttiioonn::::nnaammee or
       $${{sseeccttiioonn::::nnaammee}}. By using the form $$EENNVV::::nnaammee environment
       variables can be substituted. It is also possible to
       assign values to environment variables by using the name
       EENNVV::::nnaammee, this will work if the program looks up
       environment variables using the CCOONNFF library instead of
       calling ggeetteennvv(()) directly.

       It is possible to escape certain characters by using any
       kind of quote or the \\ character. By making the last
       character of a line a \\ a vvaalluuee string can be spread
       across multiple lines. In addition the sequences \\nn, \\rr,
       \\bb and \\tt are recognized.

NNOOTTEESS
       If a configuration file attempts to expand a variable that
       doesn't exist then an error is flagged and the file will
       not load. This can happen if an attempt is made to expand
       an environment variable that doesn't exist. For example
       the default OpenSSL master configuration file used the
       value of HHOOMMEE which may not be defined on non Unix
       systems.

       This can be worked around by including a ddeeffaauulltt section
       to provide a default value: then if the environment lookup
       fails the default value will be used instead. For this to
       work properly the default value must be defined earlier in
       the configuration file than the expansion. See the
       EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for an example of how to do this.

       If the same variable exists in the same section then all
       but the last value will be silently ignored. In certain
       circumstances such as with DNs the same field may occur
       multiple times. This is usually worked around by ignoring
       any characters before an initial .. e.g.

        1.OU="My first OU"
        2.OU="My Second OU"


EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Here is a sample configuration file using some of the
       features mentioned above.

        # This is the default section.

        HOME=/temp
        RANDFILE= ${ENV::HOME}/.rnd
        configdir=$ENV::HOME/config

        [ section_one ]

        # We are now in section one.

        # Quotes permit leading and trailing whitespace
        any = " any variable name "

        other = A string that can \
        cover several lines \
        by including \\ characters

        message = Hello World\n

        [ section_two ]

        greeting = $section_one::message

       This next example shows how to expand environment
       variables safely.

       Suppose you want a variable called ttmmppffiillee to refer to a
       temporary filename. The directory it is placed in can
       determined by the the TTEEMMPP or TTMMPP environment variables
       but they may not be set to any value at all. If you just
       include the environment variable names and the variable
       doesn't exist then this will cause an error when an
       attempt is made to load the configuration file. By making
       use of the default section both values can be looked up
       with TTEEMMPP taking priority and //ttmmpp used if neither is
       defined:

        TMP=/tmp
        # The above value is used if TMP isn't in the environment
        TEMP=$ENV::TMP
        # The above value is used if TEMP isn't in the environment
        tmpfile=${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename


BBUUGGSS
       Currently there is no way to include characters using the
       octal \\nnnnnn form. Strings are all null terminated so nulls
       cannot form part of the value.

       The escaping isn't quite right: if you want to use
       sequences like \\nn you can't use any quote escaping on the
       same line.

       Files are loaded in a single pass. This means that an
       variable expansion will only work if the variables
       referenced are defined earlier in the file.
