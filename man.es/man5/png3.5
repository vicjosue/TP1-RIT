NAME
       png - Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format

DESCRIPTION
       PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file for­
       mat for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of
       raster  images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for
       GIF and  can  also  replace  many  common  uses  of  TIFF.
       Indexed-color,  grayscale,  and  truecolor images are sup­
       ported, plus an  optional  alpha  channel.  Sample  depths
       range from 1 to 16 bits.

       PNG  is  designed  to work well in online viewing applica­
       tions, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully  stream­
       able  with  a  progressive  display option. PNG is robust,
       providing both full file integrity checking and fast, sim­
       ple detection of common transmission errors. Also, PNG can
       store gamma  and  chromaticity  data  for  improved  color
       matching on heterogeneous platforms.
