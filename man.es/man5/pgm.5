NAME
       pgm - portable graymap file format

DESCRIPTION
       The portable graymap format is a lowest common denominator
       grayscale file format.

       The format definition is as follows.

       A PGM file consists of a  sequence  of  one  or  more  PGM
       images.  There are no data, delimiters, or padding before,
       after, or between images.

       Each PGM image consists of the following:

       - A "magic number" for identifying the file type.   A  pgm
         image's magic number is the two characters "P5".

       - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

       - A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - A height, again in ASCII decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - The maximum gray value (Maxval), again in ASCII decimal.
         Must be less than 65536.

       - Newline or other single whitespace character.

       - A raster of  Width  *  Height  gray  values,  proceeding
         through the image in normal English reading order.  Each
         gray value is a number from 0  through  Maxval,  with  0
         being  black and Maxval being white.  Each gray value is
         represented in pure binary by either 1 or 2  bytes.   If
         the  Maxval  is less than 256, it is 1 byte.  Otherwise,
         it is 2 bytes.  The most significant byte is first.

       - Each gray value is a number proportional to  the  inten­
         sity  of  the  pixel, adjusted by the CIE Rec. 709 gamma
         transfer function.  (That transfer function specifies  a
         gamma  number  of 2.2 and has a linear section for small
         intensities).  A value of zero is  therefore  black.   A
         value  of  Maxval  represents CIE D65 white and the most
         intense value in the image and any other image to  which
         the image might be compared.

       - Note  that  a  common  variation on the PGM format is to
         have the gray value be "linear," i.e. as specified above
         except  without  the  gamma  adjustment.  pnmgamma takes
         such a PGM variant as input and produces a true  PGM  as
         output.

       - Characters  from  a  "#" to the next end-of-line, before
         the maxval line, are comments and are ignored.

       Note that you can use pnmdepth To convert  between  a  the
       format with 1 byte per gray value and the one with 2 bytes
       per gray value.

       There is actually another version of the PGM  format  that
       is  fairly  rare:  "plain"  PGM format.  The format above,
       which generally considered the normal one, is known as the
       "raw"  PGM  format.  See pbm(5) for some commentary on how
       plain and raw formats relate to one another.

       The difference in the plain format is:

       - There is exactly one image in a file.

       - The magic number is P2 instead of P5.

       - Each pixel in the raster is represented as an ASCII dec­
         imal number (of arbitrary size).

       - Each  pixel  in  the  raster  has white space before and
         after it.  There must be at least one character of white
         space between any two pixels, but there is no maximum.

       - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

       Here is an example of a small graymap in this format:
       P2
       # feep.pgm
       24 7
       15
       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
       0  3  3  3  3  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0 15  0
       0  3  3  3  0  0  0  7  7  7  0  0  0 11 11 11  0  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

       Programs  that  read  this  format should be as lenient as
       possible, accepting anything that looks  remotely  like  a
       graymap.


COMPATIBILITY
       Before  April 2000, a raw format PGM file could not have a
       maxval greater than 255.  Hence, it could  not  have  more
       than  one  byte  per  sample.   Old programs may depend on
       this.

       Before July 2000, there could be at most one  image  in  a
       PGM  file.   As  a result, most tools to process PGM files
       ignore (and don't read) any data after the first image.
