NAME
       sane-canon - SANE backend for Canon flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-canon  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access  to  the  following
       Canon flatbed scanners:

              CanoScan 300
              CanoScan 600
              CanoScan 2700F

       No  parallel port and USB scanners are supported and there
       are no plans to support them in the future.

       IMPORTANT: this is alpha code. Don't expect this  to  work
       correctly.  Many  functions  are  missing,  others contain
       errors. In some cases, your computer might even  hang.  It
       cannot  be  excluded  (although  I  consider  it extremely
       unprobable) that your scanner will be damaged.

       That said, TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports  and
       comments to Manuel Panea <mpd@rzg.mpg.de>.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to a SCSI scanner.  The  special  device  name
       must  be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symlink to such a
       device.  The program sane-find-scanner helps to  find  out
       the  correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could
       be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for  example.   See  sane-scsi(5)
       for details.


CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the canon.conf file is a list of device
       names that correspond to Canon scanners.  Empty lines  and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  Only one
       device name can be listed in canon.conf.


TIPS
       When scanning either slides or negatives, I found  that  I
       must  set the gamma value to something about 2.2 to 2.4 (I
       set the same value for all three red, green, blue).  Also,
       for slides, using "Auto Exposure" helps a lot.

       The  "Auto Exposure" function for slides makes the scanner
       do a first pass on the film to determine the Highlight and
       Shadow  point  values.  The "Auto Focus" function triggers
       yet another pass to determine the focus value. After that,
       the  real  scanning  pass takes place. The "Auto Exposure"
       function is not available for negatives yet.

       Even after "Auto Focus", the image I get is  often  a  bit
       too  blurred.  I  found  that using the GIMP to do a "Fil­
       ter->Enhance->Sharpen" at about  40  to  60  improves  the
       image quite a bit. In fact, I find it so good that I might
       implement a sharpen filter into the backend in the future.

       The  "native"  scanner  resolutions  of  the 2700F are the
       integer sub-multiples of 2720 dpi, i.e. 1360, 680, 340 and
       170.  You  can  scan at any other resolution, but you will
       notice that the image has  noticeably  more  jaggies  that
       when using one of the "native" resolutions.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/canon.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-canon.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-canon.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_CANON
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level for this backend.  Higher debug levels
              increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_CANON=4
