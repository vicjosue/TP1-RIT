HOSTS.EQUIV(5)      Linux Programmer's Manual      HOSTS.EQUIV(5)



NAME
       /etc/hosts.equiv  -  list  of  hosts  and  users  that are
       granted "trusted" r command access to your system

DESCRIPTION
       The hosts.equiv file allows or denies hosts and  users  to
       use  the r-commands (e.g. rlogin, rsh or rcp) without sup­
       plying a password.

       The file uses the following format:

       [ + | - ] [hostname] [username]

       The hostname is the name of  a  host  which  is  logically
       equivalent  to the local host. Users logged into that host
       are allowed to access  like-named  user  accounts  on  the
       local host without supplying a password.  The hostname may
       be (optionally) preceded by a plus (+) sign.  If the  plus
       sign  is used alone it allows any host to access your sys­
       tem.  You can expicitly deny access to a host by preceding
       the  hostname  by  a  minus (-) sign. Users from that host
       must always supply a password.  For security  reasons  you
       should  always  use  the  FQDN of the hostname and not the
       short hostname.

       The username entry grants a specific user  access  to  all
       user  accounts (except root) without supplying a password.
       That means  the  user  is  NOT  restricted  to  like-named
       accounts.  The  username may be (optionally) preceded by a
       plus (+) sign. You can also explicitly deny  access  to  a
       specific  user  by preceding the username with a minus (-)
       sign. This says that the user is  not  trusted  no  matter
       what other entries for that host exist.

       Netgroups can be specified by preceding the netgroup by an
       @ sign.

       Be extremely careful when using the plus (+) sign. A  sim­
       ple  typographical error could result in a standalone plus
       sign. A standalone plus sign is a wildcard character  that
       means "any host"!

NOTE
       Some  systems  will  only  honor the contents of this file
       when it has owner root and no write permission for anybody
       else.  Some  exceptionally  paranoid  systems even require
       that there be no other hard links to the file.
