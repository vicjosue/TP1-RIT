console.apps(5)   System Administrator's Manual   console.apps(5)



NAME
       console.apps   -   specify  console-accessible  privileged
       applications

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/security/console.apps/ directory  should  contain
       one  file  per  application that wishes to allow access to
       console users.  The filename should be  the  same  as  the
       servicename, and the contents are irrelevant; the file may
       be a zero-length file.  The application that the  file  is
       used by is free to specify the contents in any way that is
       useful for it.
