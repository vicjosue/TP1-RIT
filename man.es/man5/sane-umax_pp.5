NAME
       sane-umax_pp - SANE backend for Umax parallel port flatbed
       scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-umax_pp library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now  Easy)  backend  that provides access to Umax parallel
       port flatbed scanners.  The following scanners  work  with
       this backend:

              Model:
              --------------------
              Astra 1220P
              HP3200C
              Astra 1600P
              Astra 2000P

       This  backend handles 75x75, 150x150, 300x300, 600x600 and
       600x1200 dpi scan resolutions, in color and  gray  levels.
       There is no lineart mode.

       These scanners share the same ASIC. Only parts such as CCD
       and ADC change from one to another. They even all  reports
       being  UMAX  Astra 1220P via IEEE1284.  There isn't direct
       way to recognize them properly. Under  windows,  model  is
       set by the driver, regardless of the hardware.


       EPP MODE ONLY
              The  current  version  of  the backend use only EPP
              mode to communicate with the scanner. PS/2 and  SPP
              mode aren't implemented. It is recommended that you
              set your parallel port to EPP in BIOS with the cur­
              rent  version  of  this  backend.  ECPEPP will only
              work if you use a 2.4 kernel with  ppdev  character
              device support.

       This backend does support parport sharing only if you have
       a kernel with ppdev support.

       Note that the backend needs to run as root. To allow  user
       access  to the scanner run the backend through the network
       interface (See saned(1) and sane-net(5)).  A more  relaxed
       solution  (security  wise) is to add suid bit to the fron­
       tend (See chmod(1)).  The backend drop root priviledges as
       soon  as  it  can, right after gaining direct access to IO
       ports.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port addr

       Where addr is the base address of the port your scanner is
       attached  to.  Known ports are 0x378 (lp1) 0x278 (lp2) and
       0x3BC (lp0). Note that if you are using a Kernel 2.2.x  or
       better  ,  the first parallel port is named lp0 regardless
       of the base address. However, this  backend  requires  the
       base  address of your port. If you are not sure which port
       your  scanner  is  connected  to,  have  a  look  at  your
       /etc/conf.modules.

       You can rename any device using the

              name devname
              model model
              vendor vendor

       options. These options apply to the last port option.


CONFIGURATION
       Please  make  sure to edit umax_pp.conf before you use the
       backend.

       The contents of the umax_pp.conf file is a list of options
       and  device names that correspond to Umax scanners.  Empty
       lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       The  height  options  supported  are red-gain, green-gain,
       blue-gain, red-highlight, green-highlight, blue-highlight,
       astra, and buffer.

       Options  red-gain  , green-gain and blue-gain allow you to
       adjust the sensitivy of your scanner for the given  color.
       Values  range  from  0 (lowest gain) to 15 (highest). When
       all three gains are set to 0, the backend does  auto  gain
       tuning.


       Options red-highlight , green-highlight and blue-highlight
       allow you to adjust the highlight of your scanner for  the
       given  color. Values range from 0 (lowest highlight) to 15
       (highest).


       Option astra allows you to change the model of your  scan­
       ner.  Current  auto  detection is based on side effects on
       scanning when using 1220P command set on other models,  so
       it  may  fail on unkown hardware combination. Valid values
       are 1220, 1600 and 2000.


       Option buffer allows you to change the size  of  the  scan
       buffer.  The  size must be specified in bytes. The default
       value is 2 megabytes.





FILES
       /etc/sane.d/umax_pp.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax_pp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax_pp.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


              level   debug output
              ------- ------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               2       warnings & minor errors
               3       additional information
               4       debug information
               5       code flow (not supported yet)
               6       special debug information


       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP_LOW
              This variable sets the debug  level  for  the  SANE
              interface  for  the  Umax  ASIC. Note that enabling
              this will spam  your  terminal  with  some  million
              lines of debug output.


              level   debug output
              ------- -------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               8       command blocks
               16      detailed code flow
               32      dump datafiles
               255     everything

BUG REPORTS
       If  something  doesn't work, please contact me. But I need
       some information about your scanner to  be  able  to  help
       you...


       SANE version
              run "scanimage -V" to determine this

       the backend version and your scanner hardware
              run  "SANE_DEBUG_UMAX=255  scanimage  -L  2>log" as
              root. If you don't get any output from the  umax_pp
              backend,  make  sure  a  line "umax_pp" is included
              into your /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.   If  your  scanner
              isn't  detected, make sure you've defined the right
              port address in your umax_pp.conf.

       the name of your scanner/vendor
              also a worthy information. Please also include  the
              optical  resolution  and lamp type of your scanner,
              both can be found in the manual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if you have comments about the documentation  (what
              could  be  done better), or you think I should know
              something, please include it.
