console.perms(5)  System Administrator's Manual  console.perms(5)



NAME
       console.perms  - permissions control file for users at the
       system console

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/security/console.perms  determines  the   permissions
       that  will be given to priviledged users of the console at
       login time, and the permissions to which  to  revert  when
       the  users log out.  It is read by the pam_console module.

       The format is:

       <class>=space-separated list of words

       login-regexp|<login-class> perm dev-glob|<dev-class> \
               revert-mode revert-owner[.revert-group]

       The revert-mode, revert-owner, and revert-group fields are
       optional,  and  default  to  0600, root, and root, respec­
       tively.

       The words in a class definition are evaluated as globs  if
       they  refer  to  files, but as regular expressions if they
       apply to a console definition.  Do not mix them.

       Any line can be broken and continued on the next  line  by
       using a \ character as the last character on the line.

       The login-class class and the login-regexp word are evalu­
       ated as regular expressions.  The dev-class and  the  dev-
       glob  word  are evaluated as shell-style globs.  If a name
       given corresponds to a directory, and if  it  is  a  mount
       point  listed  in  /etc/fstab,  the device node associated
       with the filesystem mounted at that point will be  substi­
       tuted in its place.

       Classes  are denoted by being contained in < angle bracket
       > characters; a lack of < angle brackets > indicates  that
       the string is to be taken literally as a login-regexp or a
       dev-glob, depending on its input position.
