NAME
       medusa.conf  - Configuration file for the medusa index and
       search service

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/medusa/medusa.conf

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/medusa/medusa.conf current contains one option, which
       allows  system administrators to block medusa usage on the
       system, so that no user can  turn  it  on.  The  "blocked"
       option  is  off by default.  Setting it to "yes" will pre­
       vent any user,  including  root  from  using  nautilus  or
       medusa-enable-indexing   to   turn  indexing  and  indexed
       searches on for a system.
