NAME
       sane-mustek_pp  -  SANE  backend  for Mustek parallel port
       flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-mustek_pp  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner
       Access  Now  Easy)  backend that provides access to Mustek
       parallel port flatbed scanners.   The  following  scanners
       might work with this backend:

              Model:               ASIC ID:  CCD Type:  works:

       (*)  These  scanners  are  currently  not supported by the
       default driver, but patches are available; see  CIS  Scan­
       ners.

       Please note that this backend is still under construction.
       I don't know which scanners work or  which  will  work  in
       future releases.

       There  are  two  possible reasons a Mustek scanner doesn't
       work... a) the protcol is still unknown (SE 12000 P) or b)
       it's  a CIS scanner (all the others). See CIS Scanners for
       an explaination why.

       Some scanners work faster when EPP/ECP is enabled  in  the
       BIOS.

       Note  that the backend needs to run as root. To allow user
       access to the scanner run the backend through the  network
       interface  (See  saned(1) and sane-net(5)). Note also that
       the backend does not support parport sharing , i.e. if you
       try printing while scanning, your computer may crash. This
       backend also conflicts with the  sane-musteka4s2  backend.
       You can only enable one of them in your dll.conf. However,
       you  have  to  enable  the  backend  explicitly  in   your
       dll.conf,   just   remove   the  hash  mark  in  the  line
       "mustek_pp".


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port addr

       Where addr is the base address of the port your scanner is
       attached  to.  Known ports are 0x378 (lp1) 0x278 (lp2) and
       0x3BC (lp0). Note that if you are using a Kernel 2.2.x  or
       better  and  you  have only one parallel port this port is
       named lp0 regardless of the base  address.  However,  this
       backend requires the base address of your port. If you are
       not sure which port your scanner is connected to,  have  a
       look at your /etc/conf.modules.

       You can rename any device using the

              name devname
              model model
              vendor vendor

       options. These options aply to the last port option.


CONFIGURATION
       Please make sure to edit mustek_pp.conf before you use the
       backend.

       The contents of the  mustek_pp.conf  file  is  a  list  of
       options  and  device names that correspond to Mustek scan­
       ners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#)
       are ignored.

       The   nine   options  supported  are  io-mode,  wait-bank,
       strip-height, niceload, auth, wait-lamp, bw,  use600,  and
       buffer.

       Option  io-mode defines the mode of the sanei_pa4s2 inter­
       face. Possible values are try_mode_uni and alt_lock.  This
       option  may  appear  for each possible value. try_mode_uni
       allows the UNI port mode, however  this  may  disable  the
       (better)  EPP mode. alt_lock toggles between two different
       ways to lock the port for  scanner  access.   This  option
       must  come before any port definition or it won't have the
       effect you'd expect.

       Option wait-bank defines the maximal  time  in  msecs  the
       backend waits for the bank to change. The default value is
       700. If this option is given after the port  option,  only
       this device is affected. If this value is to low, you will
       get wrong colors and stripes in the scanned image.

       Option strip-height is a option that  limits  the  maximum
       height  of  the  strip scanned with a single read command.
       The height is specified in lines. If this option is  given
       after  the  port  option,  only this device is affected. A
       strip-height of zero allows to scan as much as  fits  into
       the scan buffer.

       Option  niceload  tries  to avoid to heavy load. Note that
       this reduces scan speed. This is a global option.

       Option auth turns on user authentification for this  scan­
       ner.  Use  this if you want access control and if you have
       enabled this at compile time. This option must come  after
       a  port  option.  At  the moment, this option isn't really
       supported.

       Option wait-lamp allows you to control the time the  back­
       end  waits  for the lamp to warm up. The time is specified
       in secs. The default value is 5 secs. Some  scanners  need
       longer  to  warm  up. A value of 0 makes the backend start
       without waiting.  However the backend will wait at least 2
       secs  before turning the lamp off again. If this option is
       given after a port option it affects only this device.

       Option bw defines the maximal color value that is  consid­
       ered  black  in  lineart scans.  The default value is 127.
       Possible values are between 0 and 255. If this  option  is
       given after a port option it affects only this device.

       Option  use600 enables the 600 dpi handling code. It's not
       possible to detect wether a scanner has an optical resolu­
       tion of 300x600 dpi or 600x1200 dpi. The default is to use
       the 300x600 dpi code. Use this option only if your scanner
       has an optical resolution of 600x1200 dpi. This is a local
       only option.

       Option buffer allows you to change the size  of  the  scan
       buffer.  The  size must be specified in bytes. The default
       value is 1 megabyte. If this opttion is  given  after  the
       port  option,  only  this  device is affected. If you have
       limited the strip-height, you only need a scan buffer of

              8.5 * dpi * 3 * strip-height bytes.



       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              # GLOBAL #

              # enable this option, if you think your scanner
              # supports the UNI protocol
              # note however that this might disable the better
              # EPP protocol
              #option io-mode try_mode_uni

              # choose between two different ways to lock to port
              option io-mode alt_lock

              # set the maximal height (in lines) of a strip
              # scanned (default: no limit)
              #option strip-height 0

              # wait n msecs for bank to change (default: 700
              # msecs) if this value is to low, stripes my appear
              # in the scanned image
              #option wait-bank 700

              # size (in bytes) of scan buffer (default:
              # 1 megabyte)
              #option buffer 1048576

              # try to avoid to heavy load. Note that this
              # reduces scan speed
              option niceload

              # Define the time the lamp has to be on before
              # scan starts (default 5 secs)
              #option wait-lamp 5


              # DEVICES #

              # specify the port your scanner is connected to.
              # Possible are 0x378 (lp1) 0x278 (lp2) and
              # 0x3bc (lp0)
              port 0x378

              # the following options are local to this scanner

               # scan maximal 16 lines for one sane_read() call
               option strip-height 16

               # we just need 16 * 3 * 300 * 8.5 bytes
               option buffer 122400

               # this scanner needs max 250 msecs to change
               # the bank
               option wait-bank 250

               # My scanner is a MD9848 from Medion using the
               # Mustek chipset
               name MD9848
               vendor Medion

               # Enable this option, if you want user
               # authentification *and* if it's enabled at
               # compile time
               #option auth

               # Some scanners (especially ASIC 1013) need
               # longer to warm up. This option specifies
               # the time to wait for the lamp to get hot
               #option wait-lamp 15

               # Use this option to define the maximal
               # black value in lineart scans
               #option bw 127

               # Use this option for 600 dpi scanners
               # for example ScanExpress 1200 ED Plus
               #option use600



CIS Scanners
       Some Mustek Scanners use so called contact  image  sensors
       (CIS)  instead  of cold cathode devices (CCD). These scan­
       ners have a totally different protocol; they are currently
       not supported by the default driver.

       However,  patches  are  available that support most of the
       CIS type scanners.  Check out  the  homepage  of  Eddy  De
       Greef for these patches (see the SEE ALSO section).

       These  patches  have  been  reported to work on the Mustek
       600CP, 1200CP, and 1200CP+ models, and  various  OEM  ver­
       sions  (LifeTec/Medion 9350, 9351, 9850, 9851, 9858, 9890,
       and 9891; Trust Easy  Connect  9600  plus;  Targa  Funline
       TS12EP).

       When  installing  these  patches, 3 additional options are
       available in the mustek_pp.conf  configuration  file  (see
       CONFIGURATION): cis600, cis1200, cis1200+.

       These options select the 600CP, 1200CP, or 1200CP+ version
       of the driver.  One of them must be set.

       The 600CP has a maximum resolution of 300x600 DPI, whereas
       the  1200CP  and  1200CP+  have  a  maximum  resolution of
       600x1200 DPI. The  option  must  match  your  scanner.  If
       unsure, check the manual or the box.
       Choosing  the  wrong  option  could  damage  your scanner!
       Especially, using the 1200CP settings on a  600CP  can  be
       harmful.   If the scanner starts making a loud noice, turn
       it off immediately !!!

       The cis...  options cannot be  combined  with  the  use600
       option.

       Currently,  when  installing  the CIS patches, support for
       CCD type scanners is disabled. In future versions  of  the
       sane-mustek_pp backend, the CIS patches will be integrated
       and support for both types of scanners will co-exist.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


              level   debug output
              ------- ------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               2       warnings & minor errors
               3       additional information
               4       debug information
               5       code flow (not supported yet)
               6       special debug information


       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2
              This variable sets the debug  level  for  the  SANE
              interface  for  the  Mustek chipset A4S2. Note that
              enabling this will spam  your  terminal  with  some
              million lines of debug output.


              level   debug output
              ------- -------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               2       warnings
               3       things nice to know
               4       code flow
               5       detailed code flow
               6       everything

              bw/grayscale)



BUG REPORTS
       If  something  doesn't work, please contact me. But I need
       some information about your scanner to  be  able  to  help
       you...


       SANE version
              run "scanimage -V" to determine this

       the backend version and your scanner hardware
              run   "SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP=128  scanimage  -L"  as
              root.  If  you  don't  get  any  output  from   the
              mustek_pp  backend, make sure a line "mustek_pp" is
              included into your /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.   If  your
              scanner  isn't  detected,  make sure you've defined
              the right port address in your mustek_pp.conf.

       the name of your scanner/vendor
              also a worthy information. Please also include  the
              optical  resolution  and lamp type of your scanner,
              both can be found in the manual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if you have comments about the documentation  (what
              could  be  done better), or you think I should know
              something, please include it.

       some nice greetings
