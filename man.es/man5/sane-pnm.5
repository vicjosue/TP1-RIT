NAME
       sane-pnm - SANE PNM image reader pseudo-backend

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-pnm library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides access to PNM (Portable aNyMap
       files, which covers PBM bitmap files, PGM grayscale files,
       and PPM pixmap files).  The purpose  of  this  backend  is
       primarly  to  aid in debugging of SANE frontends.  It also
       serves as an illustrative example of a minimal SANE  back­
       end.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend provides two devices called 0 and 1.

CONFIGURATION
       No configuration required.

FILES
       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-pnm.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-pnm.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_PNM
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       If the pnm backend is installed and saned is used to allow
       users  on  remote  computers to scan on the local machine,
       pnm files can be read by the remote user. This is  limited
       to  the  files  saned  can access (usually it's running as
       user "sane"). All pnm files can be read if saned  runs  as
       root  which  isn't  recommended anyway. The pnm backend is
       disabled by default. If you want to use it, enable it with
       configure (see configure --help for details). Be sure that
       only trusted users can access the pnm backend over  saned.
