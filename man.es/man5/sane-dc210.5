NAME
       sane-dc210 - SANE backend for Kodak DC210 Digital Camera

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-dc210  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access to the Kodak  DC210
       camera.  THIS  IS  EXTREMELY  ALPHA CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN
       RISK!!

DEVICE NAMES
       The current version of the backend only allows one  camera
       to be connected.  The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the dc210.conf specify the serial port and
       baud rate to use.  The baud  rate  specifies  the  maximum
       rate  to  use  while downloading pictures.  (The camera is
       always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches  to  the
       higher  rate).   On  my  90MHz  Pentium, I usually have no
       problems downloading at 115200 baud as long as the  system
       is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask flag" is
       set in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1).  Supported baud  rates
       are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some information about the
       camera to be printed.

       cmdrespause specifies how many usec  (1,000,000ths  of  a)
       between  writing the command and reading the result should
       be used. 125000 seems to be the lowest I  could  go  reli­
       ably.

       breakpause  is  the time in 1,000,000ths of a usec between
       sending the "back to default" break sending commands.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry
              cmdrespause=125000
              breakpause=1000000


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc210.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc210.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc210.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC210
              If  the library was compiled with debugging support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level  for  this  backend.   A  value of 128
              requests maximally copious  debug  output;  smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

AUTHOR
       Brian J. Murrell

       This  backend  is  based  somewhat  on  the  dc25  backend
       included in this package by Peter Fales.

       The manpage was copied from the dc25 backend and  somewhat
       edited by Henning Meier-Geinitz.
