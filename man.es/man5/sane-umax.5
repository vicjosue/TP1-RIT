NAME
       sane-umax - SANE backend for UMAX scanners


ABOUT THIS FILE
       This  file  only is a short descripton of the umax-backend
       for sane! For detailled information take a look  at  sane-
       umax-doc.html (it is included in the sane source directory
       and in the xsane online help)!


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-umax library implements a SANE backend that  pro­
       vides acces to several UMAX-SCSI-scanners and some Linotye
       Hell SCSI-scanners, parallel-  and  USB-scanners  are  not
       (and propably will never be) supported!

       I  suggest  you  hold  one hand on the power-button of the
       scanner while you try the first scans!


CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  file  for  this  backend  resides   in
            /etc/sane.d/umax.conf.

       Its  contents is a list of device names that correspond to
       UMAX and UMAX compatible scanners. Empty lines  and  lines
       starting  with  a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample con­
       figuration file is shown below:

        # this is a comment
        #
        option scsi-maxqueue 4
        option scsi-buffer-size-min 65536
        option scsi-buffer-size-max 131072
        option scan-lines 40
        option preview-lines 10
        option scsi-maxqueue 2
        option execute-request-sense 0
        option force-preview-bit-rgb 0
        option slow-speed -1
        option care-about-smearing -1
        option calibration-full-ccd -1
        option calibration-width-offset -1
        option calibration-bytes-pixel -1
        option invert-shading-data -1
        option lamp-control-available 0
        option gamma-lsb-padded 0
        /dev/sge

        #scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN
        # The following scanner supports lamp control
        option lamp-control-available 1
        scsi UMAX * Scanner * * * * *

        # scanner on /dev/scanner does not support lamp control
        option lamp-control-available 0
        /dev/scanner

        - execute-request-sense:
          values:
           0 = disabled
           1 = enabled
          default = 0
          If set to 1 umax_do_request_sense is called in
          umax_do_calibration. This can hang the system
          (but has been enabled until this version)

        - scsi-buffer-size-min, scsi-buffer-size-max:
          values: 4096-1048576, default min=32768, max=131072
          Especially the minimum value is very important.
          If this value is set too small the backend is not
          able to send gamma tables to the scanner or to
          do a correct color calibration. This may result in
          strange color effects. If the minimum value is set
          too large then the backend is not able to allocate
          the requested scsi buffer size and aborts with
          out of memory error. The default is 32KB, for
          some scanners it should be increased to 64KB.

        - scan-lines, preview-lines:
          values: 1-65535,
          default: scan-lines=40, preview-lines=10
          define the maximum number of lines that are scanned
          into one buffer

        - force-preview-bit-rgb:
          values:
           0 = disabled
           1 = enabled
          default = 0
          set preview bit in rgb real scan

        - slow-speed, care-about-smearing:
          values:
          -1 = auto
           0 = disabled
           1 = enabled
          default = -1
          dangerous options, needed for some scanners
          do not changed these options until you really know
          what you do, you may destroy your scanner when you
          define wrong values for this options

        - calibration-full-ccd:
          values:
          -1 = auto
           0 = disabled
           1 = enabled
          default = -1
          do calibration for each pixel of ccd instead of
          selected image

        - calibration-width-offset:
          values: -99999=auto, >-99999 set value
          add an offset width to the calculated with for
          image/ccd

        - calibration-bytes-pixel:
          values:
          -1 = disabled
           0 = not set
           1 = 1 byte/pixel,
           2 = 2 bytes/pixel
          use # bytes per pixel for calibration

        - invert-shading-data:
          values:
          -1 = automatically set by driver - if known
           0 = disabled
           1 = enabled
          default = -1
          invert shading data before sending it back to the scan­
       ner

        - lamp-control-available:
          values:
           0 = automatically set by driver - if known
           1 = available
          default = 0

        - gamma-lsb-padded:
          values:
          -1 = automatically set by driver - if known
           0 = gamma data is msb padded
           1 = gamma data is lsb padded
          default = -1

        - handle-bad-sense-error:
          values:
           0 = handle as device busy
           1 = handle as ok
           2 = handle as i/o error
           3 = ignore bad error code - continue sense handler,
          default = 0

        - scsi-maxqueue:
          values:
           1..# (maximum defined at compile time)
          default = 2
          most  scsi drivers allow internal command queueing with
       a depth
          of 2 commands. In most cases it does  not  mprove  any­
       thing when you
          increase  this  value.  When  your scsi driver does not
       support any
          command queueing you can try to set this value to 1.


       The special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
       symlink  to  such  a  device.  To find out to which device
       your scanner is assigned and how you have to set the  per­
       missions of that device, have a look at sane-scsi.


SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
       The  ISA-SCSI-adapters  that  are  shipped with some Umax-
       scanners are not supported very well by Linux  (I  suggest
       not  to use it), the PCI-SCSI-adapters that come with some
       Umax-scanners are not supported at all (as far as I know).
       On  other platforms these SCSI-adapters are not supported.
       So you typically need  to  purchase  another  SCSI-adapter
       that is supported by your platform. See the relevant hard­
       ware FAQs and HOWTOs for your platform for  more  informa­
       tion.

       The  UMAX-scanners do block the scsi-bus for a few seconds
       while scanning. It is not necessary to connect the scanner
       to  its  own  SCSI-adapter. But if you need short response
       time for your SCSI-harddisk (e.g. if your  computer  is  a
       file-server)  or  other scsi devices, I suggest you use an
       own SCSI-adapter for your UMAX-scanner.

       If you have any problems with  your  Umax  scanner,  check
       your scsi chain (cable length, termination, ...).

FILES
       The backend configuration file:
        /etc/sane.d/umax.conf

       The static library implementing this backend:
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax.a

       The shared library implementing this backend :
        /usr/lib/sane/libsane-umax.so
        (present on systems that support dynamic loading)


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX
        If  the  library was compiled with debug support enabled,
       this environment variable controls  the  debug  level  for
       this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug out­
       put  to  be  printed.  Smaller  levels  reduce  verbosity:
       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX values


        Number  Remark
        0       print important errors (printed each time)
        1       print errors
        2       print sense
        3       print warnings
        4       print scanner-inquiry
        5       print informations
        6       print less important informations
        7       print called procedures
        8       print reader_process messages
        10      print called sane-init-routines
        11      print called sane-procedures
        12      print sane infos
        13      print sane option-control messages
       Example:
       export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX=8


BUGS
       X-resolutions greater than 600 dpi sometimes make problems
