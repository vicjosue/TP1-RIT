NAME
       ppm - portable pixmap file format

DESCRIPTION
       The  portable pixmap format is a lowest common denominator
       color image file format.

       It should be noted that this format is egregiously ineffi­
       cient.   It is highly redundant, while containing a lot of
       information that the human eye can't even  discern.   Fur­
       thermore,  the format allows very little information about
       the image besides basic color, which means you may have to
       couple a file in this format with other independent infor­
       mation to get any decent use out of it.   However,  it  is
       very  easy  to  write and analyze programs to process this
       format, and that is the point.

       It should also be noted that files often conform  to  this
       format  in  every  respect except the precise semantics of
       the sample values.  These files are useful because of  the
       way  PPM  is  used  as  an  intermediary format.  They are
       informally called PPM files, but to be absolutely precise,
       you  should  indicate  the  variation  from true PPM.  For
       example, "PPM using the red, green, and blue  colors  that
       the scanner in question uses."

       The format definition is as follows.

       A  PPM  file  consists  of  a  sequence of one or more PPM
       images. There are no data, delimiters, or padding  before,
       after, or between images.

       Each PPM image consists of the following:

       - A  "magic  number" for identifying the file type.  A ppm
         image's magic number is the two characters "P6".

       - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

       - A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - A height, again in ASCII decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - The maximum color value (Maxval), again in  ASCII  deci­
         mal.  Must be less than 65536.

       - Newline or other single whitespace character.

       - A  raster  of  Width * Height pixels, proceeding through
         the image in normal English reading order.   Each  pixel
         is  a  triplet  of red, green, and blue samples, in that
         order.  Each sample is represented  in  pure  binary  by
         either 1 or 2 bytes.  If the Maxval is less than 256, it
         is 1 byte.  Otherwise, it is 2 bytes.  The most signifi­
         cant byte is first.

       - In  the raster, the sample values are "nonlinear."  They
         are proportional to the intensity of the  CIE  Rec.  709
         red,  green,  and blue in the pixel, adjusted by the CIE
         Rec. 709 gamma transfer function.  (That transfer  func­
         tion  specifies  a  gamma number of 2.2 and has a linear
         section for small intensities).  A value of  Maxval  for
         all  three samples represents CIE D65 white and the most
         intense color in the color universe of which  the  image
         is  part  (the  color  universe is all the colors in all
         images to which this image might be compared).

       - Note that a common variation on the  PPM  format  is  to
         have  the  sample  values be "linear," i.e. as specified
         above except without  the  gamma  adjustment.   pnmgamma
         takes  such  a  PPM variant as input and produces a true
         PPM as output.


       - Characters from a "#" to the  next  end-of-line,  before
         the maxval line, are comments and are ignored.

       Note  that  you  can use pnmdepth to convert between a the
       format with 1 byte per sample and the one with 2 bytes per
       sample.

       There  is  actually another version of the PPM format that
       is fairly rare: "plain" PPM  format.   The  format  above,
       which generally considered the normal one, is known as the
       "raw" PPM format.  See pbm(5) for some commentary  on  how
       plain and raw formats relate to one another.

       The difference in the plain format is:

       - There is exactly one image in a file.

       - The magic number is P3 instead of P6.

       - Each  sample  in  the  raster is represented as an ASCII
         decimal number (of arbitrary size).

       - Each sample in the raster has  white  space  before  and
         after it.  There must be at least one character of white
         space between any two samples, but there is no  maximum.
         There  is  no  particular  separation  of one pixel from
         another -- just the required separation between the blue
         sample  of  one  pixel  from  the red sample of the next
         pixel.

       - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

       Here is an example of a small pixmap in this format:
       P3
       # feep.ppm
       4 4
       15
        0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
        0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
        0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
       15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0

       Programs that read this format should  be  as  lenient  as
       possible,  accepting  anything  that looks remotely like a
       pixmap.


COMPATIBILITY
       Before April 2000, a raw format PPM file could not have  a
       maxval  greater  than  255.  Hence, it could not have more
       than one byte per sample.   Old  programs  may  depend  on
       this.

       Before  July  2000,  there could be at most one image in a
       PPM file.  As a result, most tools to  process  PPM  files
       ignore (and don't read) any data after the first image.
