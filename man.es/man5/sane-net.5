NAME
       sane-net - SANE network backend

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-net library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides access  to  image  acquisition
       devices  through a network connection.  This makes it pos­
       sible to control devices attached to  a  remote  host  and
       also  provides  a means to grant users access to protected
       resources.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              host:device

       Where host is the name of the (remote-) host and device is
       the  name  of  the  device  on  this  host  that should be
       addressed.  If the device name does not  contain  a  colon
       (:),  then  the  entire  string  is  treated as the device
       string for the default host.  The default host is the host
       listed last in the configuration file (see below).

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the  net.conf.   file is a list of host
       names that should be contacted for scan  requests.   Empty
       lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.
       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              scan-server.somedomain.firm
              # this is a comment
              localhost

       The above list of host names can be extended  at  run-time
       using  environment variable SANE_NET_HOSTS.  This environ­
       ment variable is a colon-separated list of hostnames  that
       should  be contacted in addition to the hosts mentioned in
       the configuration file.  For example, a user could set the
       environment variable to the string:

              new.scanner.com:scanner.univ.edu

       To request that hosts new.scanner.com and scanner.univ.edu
       are contacted in addition to the hosts listed above.

       For this backend to function properly, it is  also  neces­
       sary to define the sane service in /etc/services.  At pre­
       sent, the sane service should be defined using a  line  of
       the following form:

              sane 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon

       Note  that  port  number  6566  has  not  been  officially
       assigned to the SANE service and may change in the future.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/net.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-net.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-net.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_NET_HOSTS
              A  colon-separated  list  of  host names to be con­
              tacted by this backend.

       SANE_DEBUG_NET
              If the library  was  compiled  with  debug  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       If saned has timed out, the  net  backend  may  loop  with
       authorization requests.
