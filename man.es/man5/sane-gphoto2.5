NAME
       sane-gphoto2 - SANE backend for gphoto2 supported cameras

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-gphoto2 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access to the digital cam­
       eras  supported by gphoto2.  THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA CODE!
       USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

DEVICE NAMES
       The current version of the backend only allows one  camera
       to be connected.  The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents of the gphoto2.conf specify the characteris­
       tics of the camera to be used.   Resolutions (high resolu­
       tion,  low  resolution,  and  thumbnail size) are required
       since they are needed by the sane frontends, but can't  be
       obtained  through  the gphoto2 interface.  Valid ports and
       cameras can be obtained by  "gphoto2  --list-cameras"  and
       "gphoto2 --list-ports".

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some information about the
       camera to be printed.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

       The  "topfolder"  line  specifies  the "fixed" part of the
       file path.  For example, on the Kodak  DC-240,  files  are
       stored in the directory /DCIM/100DC240.  The /DCIM portion
       is constant, but 100DC240 will change  and  must  be  read
       from  the camers.  In this case, the line would read "top­
       folder=/DCIM"

       Some cameras don't implement a file  structure  and  store
       all  pictures  in the "/" directory.  This is indicated by
       setting "subdirs=0" with "topfolder=/"
              port=usb:
              camera=Kodak DC240
              # this is a comment
              high_resolution=1280x960
              low_resolution=640x480
              thumb_resolution=160x120
              dumpinquiry


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/gphoto2.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-gphoto2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-gphoto2.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GPHOTO2
              If the library was compiled with debugging  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for  this  backend.   A  value  of  128
              requests  maximally  copious  debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
