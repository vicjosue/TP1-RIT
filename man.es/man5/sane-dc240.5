NAME
       sane-dc240 - SANE backend for Kodak DC240 Digital Camera

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-dc240  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
       Now Easy) backend that provides access to the Kodak  DC240
       camera.  THIS  IS  EXTREMELY  ALPHA CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN
       RISK!!

DEVICE NAMES
       The current version of the backend only allows one  camera
       to be connected.  The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the dc240.conf specify the serial port and
       baud rate to use.  The baud  rate  specifies  the  maximum
       rate  to  use  while downloading pictures.  (The camera is
       always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches  to  the
       higher  rate).   On  a  450MHz  Pentium, I usually have no
       problems downloading at 115200  baud,  though  the  camera
       sometimes  has  to  resend packets due to lost characters.
       Results are better when the "interrupt-unmask flag" is set
       in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1).  Supported baud rates are:
       9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The dumpinquiry line causes  some  information  about  the
       camera to be printed.

       cmdrespause  specifies  how  many usec (1,000,000ths of a)
       between writing the command and reading the result  should
       be  used.  125000  seems to be the lowest I could go reli­
       ably.

       breakpause is the time in 1,000,000ths of a  usec  between
       sending the "back to default" break sending commands.

       Empty  lines  and  lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
       ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry
              cmdrespause=125000
              breakpause=1000000


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc240.conf
              The backend configuration file (see  also  descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc240.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-dc240.so
              The  shared library implementing this backend (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable  specifies  the  list  of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a  colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories: first, the current  working  directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment variable ends with the directory  sepa­
              rator  character,  then the default directories are
              searched after the  explicitly  specified  directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"   would   result   in    directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC240
              If the library was compiled with debugging  support
              enabled,  this  environment  variable  controls the
              debug level for  this  backend.   A  value  of  128
              requests  maximally  copious  debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

AUTHOR
       Peter S. Fales


       This backend borrows heavily from  the  dc210  backend  by
       Brian J. Murrell which is based somewhat on the dc25 back­
       end by Peter Fales.

       The manpage was largeley copied from the dc210 manpage.


BUGS
       The major limitation that I know of is  that  the  backend
       assumes the directory in the camera is 100dc240.  Once the
       camera has taken more than 9999  pictures,  the  directory
       will  increment to 101dc240.  Not only should we check for
       the additional directory, but  pictures  may  actually  be
       found in multiple directories.

       More  general  comments,  suggestions, and inquiries about
       frontends or SANE should go to the SANE Developers mailing
       list    (see   http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html   for
       details).  You must be subscribed to the  list,  otherwise
       your mail won't be sent to the subscribers.
