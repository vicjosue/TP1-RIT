NAME
       sane-v4l - SANE interface for Video for Linux API

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-v4l library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides generic access to  video  cam­
       eras and similar equipment using the V4L (Video for Linux)
       API.



DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special device
       that  corresponds  to  the v4l device.  The special device
       name must be a v4l device or a symlink to such  a  device.
       For  example,  such  a device name could be /dev/video0 or
       /dev/bttv0.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the v4l.conf file  is  a  list  of  device
       names  that  correspond  to  v4l devices.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample
       configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/bttv0
              # this is a comment
              /dev/video3

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/v4l.conf
              The  backend  configuration file (see also descrip­
              tion of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-v4l.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/sane/libsane-v4l.so
              The shared library implementing this backend  (pre­
              sent on systems that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_V4L
              If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
              enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128
              requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
