GNOME(1)                                                 GNOME(1)



NAME
       GNOME Default session configuration file.

       The  /usr/share/gnome/default.session file contains a list
       of programs to be launched the first time a user logs into
       the GNOME environment.

       The format of the file is the one used by the gnome_config
       libraries, and it looks like this:

       [Section]
       SEQID,id=uniqueID
       SEQID,Priority=PRIO
       SEQID,RestartCommand=command
       num_clients=TOP

       There are three possible names for Section And they are:

       Default

              This specifies the Default session to load

       Chooser

              Lets the user  configure  which  non-session  aware
              programs  should  be  started  up  when the session
              begins

       Warner


       Since the gnome_config file format is not  very  flexible,
       an  array  of  data is emulated by listing starting from 0
       chunks of "id,Priority,RestartCommand", and at the end the
       num_clients variable lists the number of chunks listed.

       The  uniqueid  key  provides  a name that is unique within
       this file and passed to the app as the client id which  it
       must use to register with gnome-session.

       The  RestartCommand  specifies the command to run from the
       $PATH.

       The Priority determines the order in  which  the  commands
       are  started (with Priority = 0 first) and defaults to 50.

       The clients must be  numbered  from  0  to  the  value  of
       num_clients-1
