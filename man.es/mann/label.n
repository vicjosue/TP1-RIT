WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Command-Line Name:-height
       Database Name:  height
       Database Class: Height

              Specifies a desired height for the  label.   If  an
              image  or  bitmap  is  being displayed in the label
              then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of  the
              forms  acceptable  to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is
              in lines of text.  If this option isn't  specified,
              the  label's  desired  height  is computed from the
              size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed
              in it.

       Command-Line Name:-state
       Database Name:  state
       Database Class: State

              Specifies  one of three states for the label:  nor­
              mal, active, or disabled.  In normal state the but­
              ton  is  displayed  using  the foreground and back­
              ground options.  In active state the label is  dis­
              played  using  the activeForeground and activeBack­
              ground options.  In the  disabled  state  the  dis­
              abledForeground  and  background  options determine
              how the button is displayed.

       Command-Line Name:-width
       Database Name:  width
       Database Class: Width

              Specifies a desired width for  the  label.   If  an
              image  or  bitmap  is  being displayed in the label
              then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of  the
              forms  acceptable  to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is
              in characters.  If this option isn't specified, the
              label's  desired width is computed from the size of
              the image or bitmap or text being displayed in  it.

DESCRIPTION
       The label command creates a new window (given by the path­
       Name argument) and makes it into a  label  widget.   Addi­
       tional  options,  described above, may be specified on the
       command line  or  in  the  option  database  to  configure
       aspects  of  the label such as its colors, font, text, and
       initial relief.  The label command  returns  its  pathName
       argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must
       not exist a window named pathName, but  pathName's  parent
       must exist.

       A label is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap
       or image.  If text is displayed, it must all be in a  sin­
       gle  font,  but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen
       (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because  of
       the  wrapLength  option)  and  one  of  the characters may
       optionally be underlined using the underline option.   The
       label  can  be  manipulated  in a few simple ways, such as
       changing its relief or text, using the commands  described
       below.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The  label command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may  be  used  to  invoke  various
       operations  on  the  widget.  It has the following general
       form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact  behavior  of  the
       command.   The  following  commands are possible for label
       widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the  current  value  of  the  configuration
              option given by option.  Option may have any of the
              values accepted by the label command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path­
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ­
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi­
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the values accepted by the label command.


BINDINGS
       When a new label is created, it has no default event bind­
       ings: labels are not intended to be interactive.
