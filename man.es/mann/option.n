DESCRIPTION
       The option command allows you to add  entries  to  the  Tk
       option  database or to retrieve options from the database.
       The add form of the command  adds  a  new  option  to  the
       database.   Pattern  contains  the option being specified,
       and consists of names and/or classes separated  by  aster­
       isks  or  dots,  in  the usual X format.  Value contains a
       text string to associate with pattern;  this is the  value
       that will be returned in calls to Tk_GetOption or by invo­
       cations of the option get command.  If priority is  speci­
       fied, it indicates the priority level for this option (see
       below for legal  values);   it  defaults  to  interactive.
       This command always returns an empty string.

       The  option  clear  command  clears  the  option database.
       Default options (from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property or the
       .Xdefaults  file)  will be reloaded automatically the next
       time an option is added to the database  or  removed  from
       it.  This command always returns an empty string.

       The  option  get  command  returns the value of the option
       specified for window under name  and  class.   If  several
       entries  in  the  option  database match window, name, and
       class, then the command returns whichever was created with
       highest  priority  level.   If  there are several matching
       entries at  the  same  priority  level,  then  it  returns
       whichever  entry was most recently entered into the option
       database.  If there are  no  matching  entries,  then  the
       empty string is returned.

       The  readfile  form  of  the command reads fileName, which
       should have the standard format for an X resource database
       such  as .Xdefaults, and adds all the options specified in
       that file to the option database.  If priority  is  speci­
       fied,  it  indicates  the priority level at which to enter
       the options;  priority defaults to interactive.

       The priority arguments to the option command are  normally
       specified symbolically using one of the following values:

       widgetDefault
              Level  20.  Used for default values hard-coded into
              widgets.

       startupFile
              Level 40.  Used for options specified  in  applica­
              tion-specific startup files.

       userDefault
              Level  60.  Used for options specified in user-spe­
              cific defaults files, such as .Xdefaults,  resource
              databases  loaded  into  the X server, or user-spe­
              cific startup files.

       interactive
              Level 80.  Used for options specified interactively
              after  the application starts running.  If priority
              isn't specified, it defaults to this level.

       Any of the above keywords may be  abbreviated.   In  addi­
       tion,  priorities may be specified numerically using inte­
       gers between 0 and 100, inclusive.  The  numeric  form  is
       probably  a  bad idea except for new priority levels other
       than the ones given above.
