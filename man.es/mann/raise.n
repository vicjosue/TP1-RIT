raise(n)               Tk Built-In Commands              raise(n)

NAME
       raise - Change a window's position in the stacking order

SYNOPSIS
       raise window ?aboveThis?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If  the  aboveThis  argument  is  omitted then the command
       raises window so that it is above all of its  siblings  in
       the  stacking  order  (it will not be obscured by any sib­
       lings and will obscure any siblings that overlap it).   If
       aboveThis  is specified then it must be the path name of a
       window that is either a sibling of window or  the  descen­
       dant  of a sibling of window.  In this case the raise com­
       mand will insert window into the stacking order just above
       aboveThis  (or the ancestor of aboveThis that is a sibling
       of window); this could end up either raising  or  lowering
       window.
