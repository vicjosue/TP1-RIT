SYNOPSIS
       proc name args body
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The  proc  command creates a new Tcl procedure named name,
       replacing any existing command or procedure there may have
       been  by  that name.  Whenever the new command is invoked,
       the contents of body will be executed by  the  Tcl  inter­
       preter.   Normally,  name is unqualified (does not include
       the names of any containing namespaces), and the new  pro­
       cedure  is  created  in  the  current  namespace.  If name
       includes any namespace qualifiers, the procedure  is  cre­
       ated  in the specified namespace.  Args specifies the for­
       mal arguments to the procedure.  It consists  of  a  list,
       possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies one argu­
       ment.  Each argument specifier is also a list with  either
       one or two fields.  If there is only a single field in the
       specifier then it is the name of the  argument;  if  there
       are  two  fields,  then the first is the argument name and
       the second is its default value.

       When name is invoked a local variable will be created  for
       each  of  the formal arguments to the procedure; its value
       will be the value of corresponding argument in the  invok­
       ing  command  or  the argument's default value.  Arguments
       with default values need not be specified in  a  procedure
       invocation.   However,  there  must be enough actual argu­
       ments  for  all  the  formal  arguments  that  don't  have
       defaults,  and  there  must  not be any extra actual argu­
       ments.  There is one special  case  to  permit  procedures
       with  variable  numbers  of arguments.  If the last formal
       argument has the name args, then a call to  the  procedure
       may  contain  more actual arguments than the procedure has
       formals.  In this case, all of the actual arguments start­
       ing at the one that would be assigned to args are combined
       into a list (as if the list command had been  used);  this
       combined value is assigned to the local variable args.

       When body is being executed, variable names normally refer
       to local variables, which are created  automatically  when
       referenced  and  deleted  when the procedure returns.  One
       local variable is automatically created for  each  of  the
       procedure's  arguments.   Global  variables  can  only  be
       accessed by invoking the global command or the upvar  com­
       mand.   Namespace variables can only be accessed by invok­
       ing the variable command or the upvar command.

       The proc command returns an empty string.  When  a  proce­
       dure is invoked, the procedure's return value is the value
       specified in a return command.  If the  procedure  doesn't
       execute  an  explicit return, then its return value is the
       value of the last  command  executed  in  the  procedure's
       body.   If  an  error occurs while executing the procedure
       body, then the procedure-as-a-whole will return that  same
       error.
