NAME
       concat - Join lists together

SYNOPSIS
       concat ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  treats each argument as a list and concate­
       nates them into a single list.  It also eliminates leading
       and trailing spaces in the arg's and adds a single separa­
       tor space between arg's.  It permits any number  of  argu­
       ments.  For example, the command
              concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
       will return
              a b c d e f {g h}
       as its result.

       If no args are supplied, the result is an empty string.
