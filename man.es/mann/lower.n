lower(n)               Tk Built-In Commands              lower(n)



_________________________________________________________________

NAME
       lower - Change a window's position in the stacking order

SYNOPSIS
       lower window ?belowThis?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If the belowThis argument is omitted then the command low­
       ers window so that it is below all of its siblings in  the
       stacking  order  (it will be obscured by any siblings that
       overlap  it  and  will  not  obscure  any  siblings).   If
       belowThis  is specified then it must be the path name of a
       window that is either a sibling of window or  the  descen­
       dant  of a sibling of window.  In this case the lower com­
       mand will insert window into the stacking order just below
       belowThis  (or the ancestor of belowThis that is a sibling
       of window); this could end up either raising  or  lowering
       window.
