NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  takes the contents of the specified file or
       resource and passes it to the Tcl interpreter  as  a  text
       script.   The return value from source is the return value
       of the last command executed in the script.  If  an  error
       occurs  in  evaluating the contents of the script then the
       source command will return that error.  If a  return  com­
       mand  is invoked from within the script then the remainder
       of the file will be skipped and the  source  command  will
       return normally with the result from the return command.

       The  -rsrc  and  -rsrcid  forms  of  this command are only
       available on Macintosh computers.  These versions  of  the
       command allow you to source a script from a TEXT resource.
       You may specify what TEXT resource  to  source  by  either
       name  or  id.   By  default Tcl searches all open resource
       files, which  include  the  current  application  and  any
       loaded  C  extensions.  Alternatively, you may specify the
       fileName where the TEXT resource can be found.
