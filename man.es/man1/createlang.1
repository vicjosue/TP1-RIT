NAME
       createlang - define a new PostgreSQL procedural language

SYNOPSIS
       createlang [ connection-options... ] langname [ dbname ]

       createlang [ connection-options... ]  --list | -l dbname

   INPUTS
       createlang accepts the following command line arguments:

       langname
              Specifies  the  name  of the procedural programming
              language to be defined.

       -d, --dbname dbname
              Specifies to which database the language should  be
              added.  The default is to use the database with the
              same name as the current system user.

       -e, --echo
              Displays SQL commands as they are executed.

       -l, --list
              Shows a list of already installed languages in  the
              target database (which must be specified).

       --L directory
              Specifies  the  directory  in  which  the  language
              interpreter is to be found. The directory  is  nor­
              mally found automatically; this option is primarily
              for debugging purposes.


       createlang also accepts the following command  line  argu­
       ments for connection parameters:

       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server is running. If host begins with a slash,  it
              is  used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port  or  local  Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -U, --username username
              User name to connect as

       -W, --password
              Force password prompt.


   OUTPUTS
       Most error messages are self-explanatory. If not, run cre­
       atelang  with  the --echo option and see under the respec­
       tive SQL command for details. Check also under psql(1) for
       more possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       createlang  is a utility for adding a new programming lan­
       guage to a PostgreSQL database.  createlang can handle all
       the languages supplied in the default PostgreSQL distribu­
       tion, but not languages provided by other parties.

       Although  backend  programming  languages  can  be   added
       directly  using several SQL commands, it is recommended to
       use createlang because it performs a number of checks  and
       is  much  easier  to use. See CREATE LANGUAGE [create_lan­
       guage(7)] for more.

NOTES
       Use droplang(1) to remove a language.

       createlang is a shell script  that  invokes  psql  several
       times.  If  you  have  things  arranged so that a password
       prompt is required to connect, you will be prompted for  a
       password several times.

USAGE
       To install pltcl into the database template1:

       $ createlang pltcl template1
