       kde-build has been designed to keep a local copy of
       several KDE CVS modules up to date and recompile them.
       Those modules have to be saved in a common directory, e.g.
       something like

           ~/F<kde-src>/
             |
             +-> F<kdelibs>/
             |
             +-> F<kdebase>/
             |
             \-> F<kdenetwork>/

       In this case, the KDE source directory would be ~/kde-
       src/. The script will take care of compiling them in the
       correct order, checks for dependencies and resolves them
       as far as possible.

       Please not that, prior to first invokation of the script,
       the configuration file 'kde-buildrc' has to be modified to
       reflect the local environment, such as paths etc.

       Lots, mostly that the script wasn't written with
       portability in mind and therefore won't run very nice on
       platforms other than Linux.
