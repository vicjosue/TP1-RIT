DESCRIPTION
       Faces is a window based tool for visual monitoring  lists.
       Typically  it  is  used  to  monitor mail, print queues or
       users on a system. It contains  graphical  interfaces  for
       NeWS,  SunView, XView and X11. It has five different modes
       of operation:

       The default (no -a, -H, -P or -e arguments)  will  monitor
       for  new  mail. By default, only the last ten messages are
       displayed. Using the left mouse button it is  possible  to
       toggle  the  text in the faces window. This will either be
       the username or the time the mail message arrived. You can
       clear  this  area to the background pattern by hitting the
       Delete key (but see below, under set  button1clear).   The
       icon shows the image of the last message to arrive.

       The  second  choice (-a) is to monitor the whole of a mail
       file. The open window will automatically adjust  its  size
       to  correctly show the face icons. The open window options
       are the username or the timestamp and  number  of  message
       from  that  user.  The  icon will display the image of the
       last message, and a count of the total number of  messages
       in the spool file or mail folder.

       The  third  option  (-P)  allows this program to monitor a
       given print queue.  This will generate a single face  icon
       showing  the  job  at  the top of the print queue, and the
       text message will display the printer name plus the number
       of jobs to be printed. Opening the window will show images
       of all the jobs in the queue. The text on each  image  can
       be toggled, choices being the owner's name and the size of
       the job in bytes.

       With the fourth mode (-H), you can monitor who  is  logged
       in  a  machine.  For each user, a face image is displayed.
       Text can be either the username or the  time  they  logged
       on. The iconic form displays the total number of users.

       Finally  you  can specify a program or shell script to run
       (-e).  The standard output from this program will be  read
       by  the faces program, and the appropriate faces displayed
       using the information provided. The format  of  this  face
       information is given in the faces manual page.

       There are special displays for no mail, no faces found, no
       print jobs, no paper in the printer, and no  users  logged
       into a machine.

OPTIONS
       -A          Enable audio support (where applicable).

       -B soundfile
                   The  name of the sound file to play instead of
                   making the bell sound. Audio support has to be
                   enabled.

       -C audiocmd An  alternative  command  to  use  to play the
                   audio files. Audio support has be be  enabled.

       -H hostname Name  of the machine to monitor. Faces will be
                   displayed for each user logged in.  Note  that
                   on some systems, the -ut option should be used
                   with the xterm program, if you wish to prevent
                   each xterm showing as a separate user.

       -M          Used  when  the  user  is  using a mail reader
                   which  is  capable  of  shrinking   the   mail
                   spoolfile  (Elm  and  MH  mail  being two such
                   examples)  and  the  default  mail  monitoring
                   facility within faces adjusts accordingly.

       -P printer  Printer  name  to  monitor. If this and a mail
                   spool file are given with the -s option, faces
                   will monitor the print queue.

       -S spooldir Specify an alternate mail spool directory. The
                   folder that will be  monitored  will  then  be
                   spooldir/username  where  username is the name
                   of the user currently logged in.

       -U          Automatically send  mail  to  a  special  mail
                   alias, to update the faces database when a new
                   X-Face: record is read. By default  this  spe­
                   cial  alias  is  facemaker.   This  should  be
                   aliased (see aliases(7)) to:
                   facemaker:     "|/usr/local/bin/face_update"
                   By default the face_update shell  script  will
                   not  overwriting  existing  ikons in the faces
                   database.  Overwriting will take place if  the
                   -w  option is specified.  You should also note
                   that the installation of this  mail  alias  is
                   not  done automatically, as this might be con­
                   sidered a security risk on some systems.

       -a          Monitor the whole of the specified mail  file.
                   The icon and open window display the appropri­
                   ate faces, and dynamically change  size  as  a
                   new  check  is  made  and if the mail file has
                   altered size.

       -b background
                   Sun icon or  X11  bitmap  file  containing  an
                   alternate  background  pattern. The default is
                   root grey.

       -bg color   Used with the X11 variant of faces to pick the
                   background pixel color.

       -c columns  Number  of columns of face images in each row.
                   By default this is 10.

       -d display  Used with the X11 variant of faces to give the
                   display name.

       -e program  Name  of the user program to run. This program
                   or shell script will generate lines which  the
                   faces  program will read, and then display the
                   appropriate face images. The format  of  these
                   input records is described in a later section.

       -f facepath If specified, this is a  colon-separated  list
                   of  paths  to  be searched for face images.  A
                   null entry in the path will be replaced by the
                   compiled  in  default  face directory.  If not
                   specified, the directories  specified  by  the
                   FACEPATH  environment  variable  will be used.
                   If there is no FACEPATH environment  variable,
                   the  default  face directory will be searched.
                   The  default  face   directory   is   normally
                   /usr/local/faces.   Note that in previous ver­
                   sions of faces, a -f option added  the  direc­
                   tory  to  the  search path, which already con­
                   sisted of the system default faces. Using  the
                   -f  option  now, supercedes the system default
                   faces, and you must include a  trailing  colon
                   in  the  list  of paths, in order to have them
                   included.

       -fg color   Used with the X11 variant of faces to pick the
                   foreground pixel color.

       -fn font    Used  with  the  X11  variant of faces to pick
                   which font to use for  displaying  face  names
                   and timestamps.

       -g geometry Used  with  the  X11  variant of faces to give
                   geometry information.

       -h height   The height of each face image in pixels.  Note
                   that  this is the height of the area allocated
                   to each image, and not necessarily the  height
                   of the displayed image inside.

       -iconic     Start the faces program up in iconic form.

       -i          Invert  the  faces  images  before  displaying
                   them. For use by people  who  started  SunView
                   with the -i option.

       -l label    The  label to be used in the title line of the
                   faces window.

       -n          Do not display the  number  of  messages  from
                   this  person. The default is to display, and a
                   count is shown at the bottom right  corner  of
                   the face for this person.

       -p period   The  period  in  seconds before the mail spool
                   file or the print queue is scanned  again  for
                   new mail. The default is 60 seconds.

       -rv         For  X11, displays the faces in pseudo-reverse
                   video by reversing the  foreground  and  back­
                   ground colors.

       -s spoolfile
                   Use  an  alternate mail spool file to monitor.
                   The default is /var/spool/mail/username  where
                   username  is  the  name  of the user currently
                   logged in.

       -t          Do not display a timestamp of the last message
                   from  this  person. The default is to display,
                   and a timestamp is shown at  the  bottom  left
                   corner of the face for this person.

       -u          Do  not display the username on the face icon.
                   The default is to display,  and  the  username
                   will  appear over the face icon, when the win­
                   dow is opened.

       -v          Print the version number of  this  release  of
                   the faces program.

       -w width    The  width  of each face image in pixels. Note
                   that this is the width of the  area  allocated
                   to  each  image, and not necessarily the width
                   of the displayed image inside.

       -Wi         Start the faces program  up  in  iconic  form.
                   SunView  automatically uses this flag, but the
                   NeWS version will also.

       -Wp x y     Start the open window position at x y

       -WP x y     Start the icon position at x y

AUDIO SUPPORT
       Faces is capable of playing sounds for each user when mon­
       itoring  for new mail.  Audio support needs to be enabled,
       and there must be a face.au file  present  for  that  user
       (see  FACE  FORMATS  below).  A special command is used to
       play the sounds. This can be overridden by a command  line
       option or an X resource.

FACE FORMATS
       There  is  a  special  faces directory containing a multi-
       level hierarchy, which  by  default  is  /usr/local/faces.
       The first few levels are the machine name, where each part
       of the machine name is at  a  separate  level.  One  level
       below  this  is the user name, and one level below that is
       the actual face image, which can be stored  in  four  for­
       mats.   If  the  file  is  named 48x48x1 then it is a Blit
       ikon, if it is called sun.icon then the image is stored in
       Sun  icon format, if the file is named face.xbm then it is
       an X11 xbm formatted image, and  if  the  file  is  called
       face.ps  then  it  contains executable NeWS code. Multiple
       formats can be stored in the same username directory,  and
       the  one used will depend upon which graphics interface is
       currently being used.

       For example, the  face.xbm  file  for  user  joe  at  host
       machine.att.com would be stored in the hierarchy:
       /com/att/machine/joe/face.xbm

       It  is  also  possible  to  store audio files in the faces
       directory. These files are called face.au, and  should  be
       stored under the appropriate user directory.

       To  access  the face for the mail name machine.dom.ain!uid
       take the result of the first successful open from the fol­
       lowing list of files (where $DIR represents iteration over
       the list of directories in FACEPATH):
             $DIR/ain/dom/machine/uid/iconname
             $DIR/ain/dom/uid/iconname
             $DIR/ain/uid/iconname
             $DIR/MISC/uid/iconname
             $DIR/ain/dom/machine/unknown/iconname
             $DIR/ain/dom/unknown/iconname
             $DIR/ain/unknown/iconname
             $DIR/MISC/unknown/iconname
       If the -f argument is specified  the  given  directory  is
       searched instead of /usr/local/faces.  The iconname above,
       consists of the following choices, in the given order:
          NeWS - face.ps,  sun.icon, 48x48x1, face.xbm
       SunView - sun.icon, 48x48x1,  face.xbm
           X11 - face.xbm, sun.icon, 48x48x1
       Domain names are now fully supported. For example, if mail
       arrives from foo@a.b.c then faces will use the directories
       c/b/a, c/b and c for the machine name.  The directory MISC
       hold  faces  for  generic users such as root and uucp.  If
       the faces directory hierarchy is not found, then  a  blank
       face image will be used.

       Faces information is administered by a pair of ASCII files
       in the faces directory that associate related machines and
       faces.  The machine table machine.tab attaches machines to
       communities; the line
             stard=sunaus
       puts the machine stard in community sunaus.   The  machine
       table may be used to alias entire communities; the line
             wseng.sun.com=eng.sun.com
       will  cause  the  wseng.sun.com domain to be mapped to the
       eng.sun.com community. The people table associates a  com­
       munity/alias pair, with a real username.
             sunaus/rburridge=richb
       causes  the alias rburridge to be translated into the real
       username richb for the community sunaus

       Note that you still need to use  mailtool  or  some  other
       mail  reading  utility to actually read the mail that this
       program monitors; faces simply displays who  the  mail  is
       from.

       When new mail arrives, faces will beep and flash appropri­
       ately, depending upon the set  parameters  in  the  user's
       faces startup file.  This is looked for in the user's home
       directory; first the file .facesrc is tried, and  if  that
       file  is  not  found, .mailrc is looked for.  The file, if
       found, will be examined for lines in the following form:

       set bell = number
              Give the number of times faces will ring  the  bell
              when new mail arrives.

       set flash = number
              Give  the number of times faces will flash the win­
              dow when new mail arrives.

       set raise
              faces will raise the window when new mail  arrives.

       set lower
              faces  will  lower the window when there is no mail
              left in the monitored spoolfile.

       set button1clear
              For those who liked the behaviour of previous  ver­
              sions  of  faces, this causes button 1 to clear the
              window  (like  typing  Delete).   The  ``toggling''
              function  of  button 1 is moved to button 2 if this
              option is set.  If you are using the  X11  version,
              these  parameters  may  be set via your X resources
              rather than the faces  startup  file.   See  the  X
              DEFAULTS section for more details.

       If you are using the NeWS version and creating face images
       of the face.ps form, then the following points  should  be
       noted:  All graphics operations should be performed on the
       unit square; and the final image will be translated  to  a
       64  x  64  square image at the appropriate position in the
       faces display.

       If you are using the -e option, then the user  program  or
       shell  script needs to generate a set of records which are
       interpreted by the faces program. The first record  should
       be in the following fixed format, beginning at column 1:
             Cols=mm Rows=nn
       where  mm  is the size in columns for the faces window and
       icon, and nn is the size in rows. A window will be  gener­
       ated with these dimensions.

       This  record  is followed by the face information records.
       These records can have upto six fields, each one TAB sepa­
       rated.  As  well  as  providing the username and hostname,
       there are four other fields which can be filled in,  which
       denote what is displayed on the left or the right sides of
       the bottom area of each face image in the  normal  display
       and the alternate display (normally selectable by clicking
       the left mouse button).

       The fields are:

             username
             hostname
             normal left
             normal right
             alternate left
             alternate right

       Any of these fields may be left blank. There are also four
       special  usernames,  which  will  display  the appropriate
       standard icons. These are  NOMAIL,  NOPAPER,  NOPRINT  and
       NOUSERS.

       There  can also be one optional information record for the
       faces icon display.  This uses the  first  four  of  these
       fields, and if this record is present, it should be before
       the Cols record. If not present, then the icon  will  con­
       tain the same display and text as the last window unforma­
       tion record.

XFACE SUPPORT
       Faces is capable of recognising a compressed face image in
       the mail message header.  It uses special X-Face: lines to
       do this. It is very simple to  add  your  compressed  face
       image to a mail header.

       The   following   method  works  for  Berkeley  Mail  (aka
       /usr/ucb/mail), Open Windows mailtool and mush. It  proba­
       bly works for others too.

       It  is suggested that each user store the compressed image
       (generated by compface ) in a file called .face  in  their
       home  directory.  See  the  compface  manual page for more
       information on how to generate the compressed face  image.
       The  first  line should have the X-Face: prepended; second
       and subsequent lines should  have  a  preceding  tab,  and
       there  should  be a trailing blank line. Here is a typical
       .face file:

       X-Face: *7O.<19S{MCsaxxe=iCc*y5!i:>e,K40m^btp"<`~gNx5>o?eJMzUng=j]%KybY
              VaZ/3a4pD%#rGu7D<M$.TDpaDN8#8eJC&^^&Mr]@~}Pa,*F-ePrMg5.}e,,bu
              qROdT{Vzn{!ouXy.&*#V#Q&Zf7a8lX2Kb}"$UT^VhnsJ?){wFU5r+,duO>4@L

       Each user should add the line:

       set sendmail=/usr/local/bin/faces.sendmail

       to their  ~/.mailrc  file,  where  /usr/local/bin  is  the
       directory where your faces binaries were installed.

       A  similar  method  exists with the Elm mailer. The user's
       compressed face image should be setup in a  ~/.face  file,
       but  without  the  initial  "X-Face:",  and leading spaces
       removed from each line. There is also  no  trailing  blank
       line. Here's an example:

       *7O.<19S{MCsaxxe=iCc*y5!i:>e,K40m^btp"<`~gNx5>o?eJMzUng=j]%KybY
       VaZ/3a4pD%#rGu7D<M$.TDpaDN8#8eJC&^^&Mr]@~}Pa,*F-ePrMg5.}e,,bu
       qROdT{Vzn{!ouXy.&*#V#Q&Zf7a8lX2Kb}"$UT^VhnsJ?){wFU5r+,duO>4@L

       To  automatically  include  this into a header into an Elm
       mail  message,  just  add  the  following  line  to   your
       .elm/elmheaders file:

       X-Face: `cat $HOME/.face`


X DEFAULTS
       The  X11  and  XView  versions of faces uses the following
       resources:

       audioCommand
           The name of the command to use to play audio files.


       audioSupport
           Enable audio support (where applicable).


       background
           The window's background color.  The default  value  is
           white.


       backgroundPixmap
           The  pixel map to use for tiling the background of the
           faces window  or  icon.   The  default  value  is  the
           default X11 root background pattern.


       bell
           The  number  of  times  to ring the bell when new mail
           arrives.


       bellAudioFile
           The name of an audio file to play instead of  sounding
           the bell.


       button1clear
           A  boolean  (default:  false), if set, causes faces to
           revert to the old button behavior,  namely,  button  1
           clears the window, and button two toggles the display.


       displayHostname
           A boolean (default: false), if set,  causes  faces  to
           display  the  hostname rather than the username if the
           icon represents a username rather than a hostname.


       flash
           Give the number of times to flash the window when  new
           mail arrives.


       font
           The text font.  The default value is fixed.


       foreground
           The foreground color.  The default value is black.


       geometry (class Geometry)
           The size and location of the faces window.


       iconGeometry (class Geometry)
           The size and location of the faces window.


       raise
           A  boolean  (default:  false), if true caused to raise
           it's window when new mail arrives.


       lower
           A boolean (default: false), if true  causes  to  lower
           it's  window  when  there is no mail left in the moni­
           tored spoolfile.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY        The X11 server to be used by the  XView  or
                      X11 faces program to display the face icons
                      on.

       FACEDEFAULTS   Name of the file containing the X  resource
                      information for faces.

       FACEPATH       A  colon  separated list of directory paths
                      to search for machine/user face icons.

       HOME           The home directory  of  the  current  user.
                      Used  to  locate  the  .facesrc  or .mailrc

HISTORY
       faces is based on the Bell Labs  Edition  8  program  vis­
       mon(9).  This program is not derived from vismon source.

BUGS
       The  machine and people table lookup is hopelessly ineffi­
       cient and will need to be improved as the  faces  database
       gets larger.
