       noncvslist -- List all files in a checked out CVS module
       that are not known by the CVS server.

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       When the current directory is a CVS module:

               noncvslist

       Checking checked out subdirectories:

               noncvslist [<dir>...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This script will list all files and directories in the
       module(s) that are not listed in the CVS/Entries files.
       These may be files created during builds, new un-added
       sources files etc. It is a useful housekeeping tool.

       A current limitation is that .cvsignore files are not
       checked.

       Assuming baseline/ has kdelibs/ and kdebase/ checked out
       within it:

               cd baseline/kdelibs; noncvslist
               cd baseline; noncvslist kdelibs kdebase
