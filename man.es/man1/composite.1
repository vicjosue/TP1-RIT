SYNOPSIS
       composite [ options ... ] imagecomposite [ mask ]  compos­
       ited

DESCRIPTION
       composite composite images to create new images.

EXAMPLES
       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch, use:

           composite cockatoo.miff perch.ras composite.miff

       To compute the difference between images in a series, use:

           composite -compose difference series.1 series.2 \
                     difference.miff

       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch  starting
       at location (100,150), use:

           composite -geometry "+1"00"+1"50 cockatoo.miff \
                     perch.ras composite.miff

       To tile a logo across your image of a cockatoo, use

           convert +shade 30x60 cockatoo.miff mask.miff
           composite -compose bumpmap -tile logo.png \
                     cockatoo.miff mask.miff composite.miff

       To  composite  a  red,  green, and blue color plane into a
       single composite image, try

           composite -compose CopyGreen red.png green.png \
                     red-green.png
           composite -compose CopyBlue red-green.png blue.png \
                     composite.png

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line  order.  Any  option
       you specify on the command line remains in effect until it
       is explicitly changed by specifying the option again  with
       a different effect.

       -background color
              the background color

       -cache threshold
              megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

              Image   pixels   are  stored  in  memory  until  80
              megabytes of memory have been consumed.  Subsequent
              pixel  operations are cached on disk. Operations to
              memory are significantly faster but  if  your  com­
              puter  does  not  have  a sufficient amount of free
              memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.


       -colors value
              preferred number of colors in the image

              The  actual  number  of  colors in the image may be
              less than your request, but never more. Note,  this
              is  a  color  reduction  option.  Images  with less
              unique colors than specified with this option  will
              have  any duplicate or unused colors removed. Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and  -treedepth
              affect the color reduction algorithm.


       -colorspace value
              the type of colorspace

              Choices  are:  GRAY,  OHTA,  RGB, Transparent, XYZ,
              YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, YUV, or CMYK.


              Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB
              color  space. Empirical evidence suggests that dis­
              tances in color spaces such as YUV  or  YIQ  corre­
              spond  to perceptual color differences more closely
              than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces
              may  give  better  results  when  color reducing an
              image.  Refer to quantize for more details.


              The Transparent color  space  behaves  uniquely  in
              that it preserves the matte channel of the image if
              it exists.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -comment string
              annotate an image with a comment

              Use this option to assign a specific comment to the
              image. You can include the  image  filename,  type,
              width,  height,  or other image attribute by embed­
              ding special format characters:


                   %b   file size
                   %c   comment
                   %d   directory
                   %e   filename extention
                   %f   filename
                   %h   height
                   %i   input filename
                   %k   number of unique colors
                   %l   label
                   %m   magick
                   %n   number of scenes
                   %o   output filename
                   %p   page number
                   %q   quantum depth
                   %s   scene number
                   %t   top of filename
                   %u   unique temporary filename
                   %w   width
                   %x   x resolution
                   %y   y resolution
                   \n   newline
                   \r   carriage return

              For example,


                   -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image comment of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480
              for  an  image  titled bird.miff and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.


              If the first character of string is  @,  the  image
              comment is read from a file titled by the remaining
              characters in the string.


       -compose operator
              the type of image composition

              By default, each of the composite image pixels  are
              replaced by the corresponding image tile pixel. You
              can choose an alternate composite operation:


                   Over
                   In
                   Out
                   Atop
                   Xor
                   Plus
                   Minus
                   Add
                   Subtract
                   Difference
                   Multiply
                   Bumpmap
                   Copy
                   CopyRed
                   CopyGreen
                   CopyBlue
                   CopyOpacity

              How each operator behaves is described below.


               Over


                    The result will be the union of the two image
                    shapes,  with opaque areas of composite image
                    obscuring image in the region of overlap.

               In


                    The result is simply composite image  cut  by
                    the  shape  of image.  None of the image data
                    of image will be in the result.

               Out


                    The resulting image is composite  image  with
                    the shape of image cut out.

               Atop


                    The  result is the same shape as image image,
                    with composite image  obscuring  image  where
                    the  image shapes overlap.  Note this differs
                    from over because the  portion  of  composite
                    image  outside  image's shape does not appear
                    in the result.

               Xor


                    The result is the image data from  both  com­
                    posite  image  and  image that is outside the
                    overlap region.  The overlap region  will  be
                    blank.

               Plus


                    The result is just the sum of the image data.
                    Output values are cropped to  255  (no  over­
                    flow).   This operation is independent of the
                    matte channels.

               Minus


                    The result of composite image -  image,  with
                    underflow cropped to zero.  The matte channel
                    is ignored (set to 255, full coverage).

               Add


                    The result of composite image +  image,  with
                    overflow wrapping around (mod 256).

               Subtract


                    The  result  of composite image - image, with
                    underflow wrapping around (mod 256).  The add
                    and subtract operators can be used to perform
                    reversible transformations.

               Difference


                    The result of abs(composite image  -  image).
                    This is useful for comparing two very similar
                    images.

               Multiply


                    The result of composite image * image.   This
                    is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

               Bumpmap


                    The result image shaded by composite image.

               Copy


                    The  resulting  image  is image replaced with
                    composite image.  Here the matte  information
                    is ignored.

               CopyRed


                    The resulting image is the red layer in image
                    replaced with  the  red  layer  in  composite
                    image.    The   other   layers   are   copied
                    untouched.

               CopyGreen


                    The resulting image is  the  green  layer  in
                    image  replaced  with the green layer in com­
                    posite image.  The other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.

               CopyBlue


                    The  resulting  image  is  the  blue layer in
                    image replaced with the blue layer in compos­
                    ite  image.   The  other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.

               CopyOpacity


                    The resulting image is  the  matte  layer  in
                    image  replaced  with the matte layer in com­
                    posite image.  The other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.



               The  image  compositor  requires a matte, or alpha
               channel in the image for  some  operations.   This
               extra  channel usually defines a mask which repre­
               sents a sort of a  cookie-cutter  for  the  image.
               This is the case when matte is 255 (full coverage)
               for pixels inside the  shape,  zero  outside,  and
               between zero and 255 on the boundary.  For certain
               operations, if image does not have a  matte  chan­
               nel, it is initialized with 0 for any pixel match­
               ing in color to pixel  location  (0,0),  otherwise
               255 (to work properly borderwidth must be 0).


       -compress type
              the type of image compression

              Choices  are:  None,  BZip, Fax, Group4, JPEG, LZW,
              RLE or Zip.


              Specify +compress to store the binary image  in  an
              uncompressed  format.   The default is the compres­
              sion type of the specified image file.


       -debug enable debug printout

       -density <width>x<height>
              vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the
              image

              This  option specifies an image density when decod­
              ing a PostScript or  Portable  Document  page.  The
              default  is  72 dots per inch in the horizontal and
              vertical direction. This option is used in  concert
              with -page.


       -depth value
              depth of the image

              This  is  the  number  of bits in a pixel. The only
              acceptable values are 8 or 16.  Use this option  to
              specify  the  depth  of  raw  images whose depth is
              unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK,  or  to  change
              the depth of any image after it has been read.


       -displace <horizontal scale>x<vertical scale>
              shift image pixels as defined by a displacement map

              With this option, composite image is used as a dis­
              placement map.  Black, within the displacement map,
              is a maximum positive  displacement.   White  is  a
              maximum  negative  displacement  and middle gray is
              neutral.  The displacement is scaled  to  determine
              the  pixel  shift.   By  default,  the displacement
              applies in both the horizontal and vertical  direc­
              tions.   However,  if  you  specify mask, composite
              image is the horizontal X displacement and mask the
              vertical Y displacement.


       -display host:display[.screen]
              specifies the X server to contact

       -dispose method
              GIF disposal method

              Here are the valid methods:


                   0     No disposal specified.
                   1     Do not dispose between frames.
                   2      Overwrite  frame  with background color
              from header.
                   3     Overwrite with previous frame.

       -dissolve value
              dissolve an image

       -dither
              apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

              The basic strategy of dithering is to trade  inten­
              sity resolution for spatial resolution by averaging
              the  intensities  of  several  neighboring  pixels.
              Images  which  suffer  from  severe contouring when
              reducing colors can be improved with this option.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


              Use  +dither  to  render Postscript without text or
              graphic aliasing.


       -filter type
              use this type of filter when resizing an image

              Use this option to affect the resizing operation of
              an  image  (see -geometry).  Choose from these fil­
              ters:


                   Point
                   Box
                   Triangle
                   Hermite
                   Hanning
                   Hamming
                   Blackman
                   Gaussian
                   Quadratic
                   Cubic
                   Catrom
                   Mitchell
                   Lanczos
                   Bessel
                   Sinc

              The default filter is Lanczos


       -font name
              use this font when annotating the image with text

              You can tag a font  to  specify  whether  it  is  a
              Postscript,  Truetype,  or OPTION1 font.  For exam­
              ple, Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica  is
              Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1.


       -geometry    <width>x<height>{+-}<x   offset>{+-}<y   off­
       set>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
              preferred size and location of the Image window.

              See  X(1) for details about the geometry specifica­
              tion. By default, the window size is the image size
              and  the  location  is  chosen  by  you  when it is
              mapped.


              By default, the width and height are  maximum  val­
              ues.  That  is, the image is expanded or contracted
              to fit the width and height value while maintaining
              the  aspect  ratio of the image. Append an exclama­
              tion point to the geometry to force the image  size
              to  exactly  the  size you specify. For example, if
              you specify 640x480! the image width is set to  640
              pixels  and  height  to  480. If only one factor is
              specified, both the width  and  height  assume  the
              value.


              To  specify  a  percentage width or height instead,
              append %. The image size is multiplied by the width
              and  height  percentages  to obtain the final image
              dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a
              value  greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an
              image's size, use a percentage less than 100.


              Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels  of  an
              image.


              Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification.  <
              resizes  the  image  only if its dimensions is less
              than the geometry specification.  For  example,  if
              you  specify  '640x480>'  and  the  image  size  is
              512x512, the image size does not  change.  However,
              if  the  image  is  1024x1024,  it  is  resized  to
              640x480.


              Use < to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its  size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification. >
              resizes the image only if its  dimensions  is  less
              than  the  geometry  specification. For example, if
              you specify 640x480> and the image size is 512x512,
              the  image  size  does  not change. However, if the
              image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.


              There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript  coordi­
              nates.


       -gravity type
              direction  text  gravitates  to when annotating the
              image.

              Choices are:  NorthWest,  North,  NorthEast,  West,
              Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast. See X(1)
              for details about the gravity specification.


              The direction you choose specifies where  to  posi­
              tion  the text when annotating the image. For exam­
              ple Center gravity forces the text to  be  centered
              within  the image. By default, the image gravity is
              NorthWest.


       -help  print usage instructions

       -interlace type
              the type of interlacing scheme

              Choices are: None, Line, Plane, or  Partition.  The
              default is None.


              This  option  is used to specify the type of inter­
              lacing scheme for raw image formats such as RGB  or
              YUV.  None  means do not interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRG­
              BRGB...),   Line    uses    scanline    interlacing
              (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),  and  Plane
              uses               plane                interlacing
              (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).   Partition  is like
              plane except the  different  planes  are  saved  to
              individual   files   (e.g.  image.R,  image.G,  and
              image.B).


              Use Line, or Plane to create an interlaced  PNG  or
              GIF or progressive JPEG image.


       -label name
              assign a label to an image

              Use  this  option to assign a specific label to the
              image. Optionally you can include the  image  file­
              name, type, width, height, or other image attribute
              by embedding special format character. See -comment
              for details.


              For example,


                   -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces  an  image label of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480
              for an image titled bird.miff and  whose  width  is
              512 and height is 480.


              If  the  first  character of string is @, the image
              label is read from a file titled by  the  remaining
              characters in the string.


              When  converting  to PostScript, use this option to
              specify a header string to print above  the  image.
              Specify the label font with -font.


       -matte store matte channel if the image has one

              If  the image does not have a matte channel, create
              an opaque one.


       -monochrome
              transform the image to black and white

       -negate
              replace every pixel with its complementary color

              The red, green, and blue intensities  of  an  image
              are  negated.   White becomes black, yellow becomes
              blue,  etc.   Use  +negate  to  only   negate   the
              grayscale pixels of the image.


       -page     <width>x<height>{+-}<x     offset>{+-}<y    off­
       set>{%}{!}{<}{>}
              size and location of an image canvas

              Use  this  option  to specify the dimensions of the
              PostScript page in dots per inch or a TEXT page  in
              pixels. The choices for a Postscript page are:

              For  convenience  you  can specify the page size by
              media (e.g. A4,  Ledger,  etc.).  Otherwise,  -page
              behaves  much  like  -geometry  (e.g.   -page  let­
              ter+43+43>).


              To position  a  GIF  image,  use  -page{+-}<x  off­
              set>{+-}<y offset> (e.g. -page +100+200).


              For  a  Postscript  page,  the image is sized as in
              -geometry and positioned relative to the lower left
              hand corner of the page by {+-}<xoffset>{+-}<y off­
              set>. Use -page 612x792>, for  example,  to  center
              the  image  within  the  page.  If  the  image size
              exceeds the Postscript page, it is reduced  to  fit
              the page.


              The  default  page  dimensions  for a TEXT image is
              612x792.


              This option is used in concert with -density.


       -profile filename
              add ICM color or IPTC newswire information  profile
              to image

              Use  +profile  icm  or  +profile iptc to remove the
              respective profile.


       -quality value
              JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level

              For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst)  to
              100 (best). The default quality is 75.


              Quality  for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the
              amount of image compression (quality / 10) and fil­
              ter-type (quality % 10). Compression quality values
              range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). If  filter-type
              is 4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for
              all scanlines:


                   0: none
                   1: sub
                   2: up
                   3: average
                   4: Paeth

              If filter-type is 5,  adaptive  filtering  is  used
              when  quality is greater than 50 and the image does
              not have a color map,  otherwise  no  filtering  is
              used.


              If  filter-type  is  6  or more, adaptive filtering
              with minimum-sum-of-absolute-values is used.


              The default is quality is 75.  Which  means  nearly
              the best compression with adaptive filtering.


              For further information, see the PNG specification.


       -rotate degrees{<}{>}
              apply Paeth image rotation to the image

              Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds
              the  height.  < rotates the image only if its width
              is less than the height. For example, if you  spec­
              ify  -90>  and the image size is 480x640, the image
              is not rotated by the specified angle. However,  if
              the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.


              Empty triangles left over from rotating  the  image
              are  filled  with  the  color defined as background
              (class backgroundColor). See X(1) for details.


       -scene value{-value}
              image scene number or range

              Use this option to specify an image sequence with a
              single  filename.  See the discussion of file below
              for details.

       -size <width>x<height>{+offset}
              width and height of the image

              Use this option to specify the width and height  of
              raw  images  whose  dimensions  are unknown such as
              GRAY, RGB,  or  CMYK.  In  addition  to  width  and
              height, use -size with an offset to skip any header
              information in the image or tell the number of col­
              ors  in a MAP image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally, use this option  to  choose  a  particular
              resolution  layer  of  a  JBIG  or JPEG image (e.g.
              -size 1024x768).


       -stackdrop file
              stack some images in "drop" mode

              This feature is untested.


       -stackreplace file
              stack some images in "replace" mode

              This feature is untested.


       -treedepth value
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero
              or  one  tells  display  to  choose an optimal tree
              depth for the color reduction algorithm

              An optimal depth generally allows the  best  repre­
              sentation of the source image with the fastest com­
              putational speed and the least  amount  of  memory.
              However,  the  default  depth  is inappropriate for
              some images. To assure the best representation, try
              values  between  2 and 8 for this parameter.  Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -type type
              the image type

              Choose from: Bilevel, Grayscale, Palette, PaletteM­
              atte, TrueColor,  TrueColorMatte,  ColorSeparation,
              ColorSeparationMatte, or Optimize.


       -units type
              the type of image resolution

              Choose  from:  Undefined,  PixelsPerInch,  or  Pix­
              elsPerCentimeter.


       -unsharp <radius>x<sigma>
              sharpen the image with an unsharp mask operator

              Use  the  given  radius  and   standard   deviation
              (sigma).


       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is  printed: image scene number;
              image name; image size; the  image  class  (Direct­
              Class  or  PseudoClass); the total number of unique
              colors; and the  number  of  seconds  to  read  and
              transform  the image.  Refer to miff for a descrip­
              tion of the image class.


              If -colors is also specified, the total unique col­
              ors  in  the image and color reduction error values
              are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of
              these values.


FILES AND FORMATS
       By  default,  the  image format is determined by its magic
       number. To specify a particular image format, precede  the
       filename  with  an  image  format  name  and a colon (i.e.
       ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
       (i.e.  image.ps). See convert(1) for a list of valid image
       formats.

       When you specify X as your image type,  the  filename  has
       special  meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or
       root. If no filename is specified, the window is  selected
       by clicking the mouse in the desired window.

       Specify image as - for standard input, composited as - for
       standard output. If image has the extension .Z or .gz, the
       file  is  uncompressed  with  uncompress or gunzip respec­
       tively.  If composited has the extension .Z  or  .gz,  the
       file  size  is  compressed  using  with  compress  or gzip
       respectively.  Finally, precede the image file name with |
       to pipe to or from a system command.

       Use  an  optional  index enclosed in brackets after a file
       name to specify a desired subimage of  a  multi-resolution
       image  format  like  Photo  CD (e.g.  img0001.pcd[4]) or a
       range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]). A  subimage
       specification  can  be  disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]).
       For raw images, specify a subimage with a  geometry  (e.g.
       -size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

       The optional mask can be used to provide matte information
       for composite when it has none or if you want a  different
       mask.  A  mask  image  is typically grayscale and the same
       size as composite. If the image is not  grayscale,  it  is
       converted  to  grayscale and the resulting intensities are
       used as matte information.

       If composited already exists, you will be prompted  as  to
       whether it should be overwritten.
