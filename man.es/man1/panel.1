DESCRIPTION
       panel  The  GNOME  Panel  is  the  heart of the GNOME user
       interface and acts as a repository for the Main Menu, user
       menus,  application launchers, applets (applications which
       run entirely within the panel), drawers, and several  spe­
       cial  objects. The Panel was designed to be highly config­
       urable. You can easily customize its behavior and  appear­
       ance  and  add  or  remove  objects to suite your personal
       needs and preferences. You can even have multiple  panels,
       each  with  its  own appearance, properties, and contents.
       This flexibility allows you to easily create a comfortable
       and efficient personalized desktop environment.
