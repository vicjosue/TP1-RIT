NAME
       gcolorsel - the GNOME Color Browser

SYNOPSIS
       gcolorsel

       or  select Color Browser from the Utilities submenu of the
       Main Menu.

DESCRIPTION
       GNOME Color Browser is  a  utility  for  selecting  screen
       (i.e.,  X Window System) color.  The X Window System comes
       with many pre-defined colors,  from  Alice  Blue  to  Pale
       Goldenrod  to  Yellow  Green. GNOME Color Browser lets you
       browse these colors and select one of them to be  used  by
       an application. It also allows you define your own collec­
       tion of favorite colors, or find a pre-defined color  most
       closely matching a given one.

       For  full documentation see the GNOME Color Browser online
       help.
