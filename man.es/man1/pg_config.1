PG_CONFIG(1)      PostgreSQL Client Applications     PG_CONFIG(1)



NAME
       pg_config  - retrieve information about the installed ver­
       sion of PostgreSQL

SYNOPSIS
       pg_config { --bindir | --includedir |  --includedir-server
       | --libdir | --pkglibdir | --configure | --version }...

DESCRIPTION
       The  pg_config  utility prints configuration parameters of
       the currently  installed  version  of  PostgreSQL.  It  is
       intended,  for  example,  to  be used by software packages
       that want to interface to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding
       the required header files and libraries.

OPTIONS
       To  use  pg_config,  supply  one  or more of the following
       options:

       --bindir
              Print the location of user executables.  Use  this,
              for example, to find the psql program. This is nor­
              mally also the location where the pg_config program
              resides.

       --includedir
              Print the location of C and C++ header files of the
              client interfaces.

       --includedir-server
              Print the location of C and C++  header  files  for
              server programming.

       --libdir
              Print the location of object code libraries.

       --pkglibdir
              Print the location of dynamically loadable modules,
              or where the server would search for  them.  (Other
              architecture-dependent   data  files  may  also  be
              installed in this directory.)

       --configure
              Print the options that were given to the  configure
              script when PostgreSQL was configured for building.
              This can be used to reproduce the identical config­
              uration,  or to find out with what options a binary
              package was built. (Note however that binary  pack­
              ages often contain vendor-specific custom patches.)

       --version
              Print the version of PostgreSQL and exit.

       If more than one option (except for --version)  is  given,
       the  information  is  printed  in that order, one item per
       line.

NOTES
       The option --includedir-server is new in  PostgreSQL  7.2.
       In prior releases, the server include files were installed
       in the same location as the client headers, which could be
       queried with the --includedir. To make your package handle
       both cases, try the newer option first and test  the  exit
       status to see whether it succeeded.

       In  releases prior to PostgreSQL 7.1, before the pg_config
       came to be, a method for finding the equivalent configura­
       tion information did not exist.

HISTORY
       The pg_config utility first appeared in PostgreSQL 7.1.
