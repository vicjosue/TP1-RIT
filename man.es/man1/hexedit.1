HEXEDIT(1)                                             HEXEDIT(1)



NAME
       hexedit - view and edit files in hexadecimal or in ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       hexedit  [-s  |  --sector] [-m | --maximize] [-h | --help]
       [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       hexedit shows a file both in ASCII and in hexadecimal. The
       file  can  be  a  device  as the file is read a piece at a
       time. You can modify the file and search through it.

OPTIONS
       -s, --sector
              Format the display to have entire sectors.

       -m, --maximize
              Try to maximize the display.

       -h, --help
              Show the usage.

       o Ctrl+C - unconditional quit (without saving).
       o F10, Ctrl+X - quit.

       For  the  Esc  commands,  it  sometimes  works  to use Alt
       instead of Esc. Funny things here (especially for froggies
       :) egrave = Alt+H , ccedilla = Alt+G, Alt+Y = ugrave.

   Modeline
       At the bottom of the display you have the modeline (copied
       from emacs). As in emacs, you have the indications --,  **
       and  %%  meaning  unmodified, modified and read-only. Then
       you have the name of the file  you're  currently  editing.
       Next  to  it  is the current position of the cursor in the
       file followed by the total file size. The total file  size
       isn't quite correct for devices.
       While  in --sector mode, it shows the sector the cursor is
       in.

   Editing
       You can edit in ASCII or in hexadecimal.  You  can  switch
       between  the two with Tab. When the file is read-only, you
       can't edit it. When trying to edit  a  read-only  file,  a
       message  (``File  is  read-only'')  tells  you  it is non-
       writable.
       The modifications are shown in bold until they are  saved.
       The  modeline indicates whether you have modified the file
       or not.
       When editing in hexadecimal,  only  0,1,...,9,  a,b,...,f,
       A,B,...F  are  legal.   Other  keys are unbound. The first
       time you hit an unbound key, the help pops up.   It  won't
       pop again unless you call the help directly (with F1).
       When  editing in ascii, you can find it difficult to enter
       characters like / which are bound to a function. The solu­
       tion  is to use the quoted insert function Ctrl+Q, the key
       after the quoted  insert  function  is  not  processed  by
       hexedit  (like emacs' quoted-insert, or like the \ charac­
       ter in C).

   Searching
       You can search for a string in ASCII  or  in  hexadecimal.
       You  can switch between the two with Tab. If the string is
       found, the cursor is moved to the beginning of the  match­
       ing  location.  If  the  search  failed,  a message (``not
       found'') tells you so. You can cancel the search by press­
       ing a key.
       The  search  in  hexadecimal  is a bit confusing. You must
       give a hexadecimal string with an even number  of  charac­
       ters.  The  search  can  then be done byte by byte. If you
       want to search a long number (eg: a 32  bit  number),  you
       must know the internal representation of that number (lit­
       tle/big endian problem) and give it the way it is in  mem­
       ory.  For  example, on an Intel processor (little endian),
       you  must  swap  every  bytes:   0x12345678   is   written
       0x78563412  in  memory and that's the string you must give
       to the search engine.
       Before searching you are asked if you  want  to  save  the
       changes, if the file is edited.

   Selecting, copying, pasting, filling
       First,  select  the  part  of the buffer you want to copy:
       start setting the mark where you want. Then go to the  end
       of  the area you want to copy (you can use the go to func­
       tion and the search functions). Then copy it. You can then
       paste  the  copied  area in the current file or in another
       file.

       You can also fill the selected area with  a  string  or  a
       character:  start  choosing  the block you want to fill in
       (set mark then move to the end of the block), and call the
       fill  function  (F12). hexedit ask you the string you want
       to fill the block with.
       The code is not tuned for huge filling  as  it  keeps  the
       modifications  in  memory  until you save them. That's why
       hexedit will warn you if you try to fill in a big block.

       When the mark is set, the selection is  shown  in  reverse
       mode.
       Be  aware  that the copied area contains the modifications
       done at the time of the copy. But if you undo the  modifi­
       cations,  it  does  not  change  the  content  of the copy
       buffer. It seems obvious but it's worth saying.

   Scrolling
       The scrolling is different whether  you  are  in  --sector
       mode  or  not.  In  normal  mode, the scrolling is line by
       line. In sector mode, the scrolling is sector  by  sector.
       In  both  modes,  you  can force the display to start at a
       given position using Esc+L.

TODO
       Anything you think could be nice...

LIMITATIONS
       There are problems with the curses library given with Red­
       hat 5.0 that make hexedit think the terminal is huge.  The
       result is that hexedit is not usable.

       The  shortcuts  work  on some machines, and not on others.
       That's why there are many shortcuts for each function. The
       Ctrl+Arrows  and the Alt+. do not work work as they should
       most of the time.  On  SUNs,  you  must  do  Ctrl+V-Ctrl+V
       instead of Ctrl+V (!); and the Alt key is the diamond one.

       While searching, it could be  interesting  to  know  which
       position  the  search has reached. It's always nice to see
       something moving to help waiting.

       The hexadecimal search could be able to  search  modulo  4
       bits  instead of 8 bits.  Another feature could be to com­
       plete padd odd length hexadecimal searches with zeros.

BUGS
       I have an example where the display is  completly  screwed
       up. It seems to be a bug in ncurses (or maybe in xterm and
       rxvt)?? Don't know if  it's  me  using  ncurses  badly  or
       not...  It  seems  to  happen when hexedit leaves only one
       space at the end of the lines... If anyone has a (or  the)
       solution, please tell me!

       If  you  have  any  problem with the program (even a small
       one), please do report it to me. Remarks of any  kind  are
       also welcome.
