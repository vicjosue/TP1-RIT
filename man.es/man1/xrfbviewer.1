NAME
       xrfbviewer - a VNC viewer

SYNOPSIS
       xrfbviewer [OPTIONS] [[host]:display]

       xrfbviewer [OPTIONS] -listen display

       xrfbviewer [OPTIONS] -stdio

       xrfbviewer { -about | -help }

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  full-featured  VNC viewer that supports macro
       recording and session capturing.

       The first form is for normal VNC viewing.  If no  host  is
       specified,  a dialog box prompts for one. (It is this dia­
       log box that allows macro recording and session  capturing
       to be specified.)

       The  second  form, with -listen, is for listen mode; a VNC
       server can make a connection to the viewer in listen mode.

       The  third  form,  with  -stdio,  causes xrfbviewer to use
       stdin and  stdout  for  RFB  communications  (for  use  in
       inetd-type situations).

       The  fourth  form  is  for getting information about xrfb­
       viewer.

OPTIONS
       -shared
              Allow the session to be shared.

       -viewonly
              Don't send keystrokes or mouse movements.

       -bgr233
              Use BGR233 pixel format.

       -spf   Use the server's pixel format.

       -scale fact/div
              Scale by the specified factor and divisor.
