NAME
       ospent - Concatenate entities

SYNOPSIS
       ospent [-Cnrv] [-bbctf] [-Ddirectory] [sysid...]



DESCRIPTION
       ospent  (OpenJade SGML print entity) prints the concatena­
       tion of the entities with system identifiers [sysid...] on
       the standard output.


       The following options are available:


       -bbctf Use the BCTF with name bctf for output.


       -C     This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -Ddirectory
              Search  directory  for  files  specified  in system
              identifiers. This has the same effect  as  in  ons­
              gmls(1).


       -n     The  entity  is a non-SGML data entity. This option
              forces the octets in the storage objects comprising
              the  entity to be copied exactly without any of the
              conversions  that  are  done  for  text   entities.
              Implies -r.


       -r     Raw output. Don't perform any conversion on RSs and
              REs when printing the entity. The entity would typ­
              ically   have   the   storage   manager   attribute
              records=asis.


       -v     Print the version number.
