       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of
       files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP pro­
       tocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
       background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows
       you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system,
       letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the
       Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can
       be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

       Wget can follow links in HTML pages and create local ver­
       sions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory
       structure of the original site.  This is sometimes
       referred to as ``recursive downloading.''  While doing
       that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard
       (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
       links in downloaded HTML files to the local files for
       offline viewing.

       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unsta­
       ble network connections; if a download fails due to a net­
       work problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file
       has been retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it
       will instruct the server to continue the download from
       where it left off.

       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Display the version of Wget.

       --hh
       ----hheellpp
           Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-
           line options.

       --bb
       ----bbaacckkggrroouunndd
           Go to background immediately after startup.  If no
           output file is specified via the --oo, output is redi­
           rected to wget-log.

       --ee command
       ----eexxeeccuuttee command
           Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc.  A
           command thus invoked will be executed after the com­
           mands in .wgetrc, thus taking precedence over them.

       --oo logfile
       ----oouuttppuutt--ffiillee==logfile
           Log all messages to logfile.  The messages are nor­
           mally reported to standard error.

       --aa logfile
       ----aappppeenndd--oouuttppuutt==logfile
           Append to logfile.  This is the same as --oo, only it
           appends to logfile instead of overwriting the old log
           file.  If logfile does not exist, a new file is cre­
           ated.

       --dd
       ----ddeebbuugg
           Turn on debug output, meaning various information
           important to the developers of Wget if it does not
           work properly.  Your system administrator may have
           chosen to compile Wget without debug support, in which
           case --dd will not work.  Please note that compiling
           with debug support is always safe---Wget compiled with
           the debug support will not print any debug info unless
           requested with --dd.

       --qq
       ----qquuiieett
           Turn off Wget's output.

       --vv
       ----vveerrbboossee
           Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.
           The default output is verbose.

       --nnvv
       ----nnoonn--vveerrbboossee
           Non-verbose output---turn off verbose without being
           completely quiet (use --qq for that), which means that
           error messages and basic information still get
           printed.

       --ii file
       ----iinnppuutt--ffiillee==file
           Read URLs from file, in which case no URLs need to be
           on the command line.  If there are URLs both on the
           command line and in an input file, those on the com­
           mand lines will be the first ones to be retrieved.
           The file need not be an HTML document (but no harm if
           it is)---it is enough if the URLs are just listed
           sequentially.

           However, if you specify ----ffoorrccee--hhttmmll, the document
           will be regarded as hhttmmll.  In that case you may have
           problems with relative links, which you can solve
           either by adding "<base href="url">" to the documents
           or by specifying ----bbaassee==url on the command line.

       --FF
       ----ffoorrccee--hhttmmll
           When input is read from a file, force it to be treated
           as an HTML file.  This enables you to retrieve rela­
           tive links from existing HTML files on your local
           disk, by adding "<base href="url">" to HTML, or using
           the ----bbaassee command-line option.

       --BB URL
       ----bbaassee==URL
           When used in conjunction with --FF, prepends URL to rel­
           ative links in the file specified by --ii.

       ----bbiinndd--aaddddrreessss==ADDRESS
           When making client TCP/IP connections, "bind()" to
           ADDRESS on the local machine.  ADDRESS may be speci­
           fied as a hostname or IP address.  This option can be
           useful if your machine is bound to multiple IPs.

       --tt number
       ----ttrriieess==number
           Set number of retries to number.  Specify 0 or iinnff for
           infinite retrying.

       --OO file
       ----oouuttppuutt--ddooccuummeenntt==file
           The documents will not be written to the appropriate
           files, but all will be concatenated together and writ­
           ten to file.  If file already exists, it will be over­
           written.  If the file is --, the documents will be
           written to standard output.  Including this option
           automatically sets the number of tries to 1.

       --nncc
       ----nnoo--cclloobbbbeerr
           If a file is downloaded more than once in the same
           directory, Wget's behavior depends on a few options,
           including --nncc.  In certain cases, the local file will
           be clobbered, or overwritten, upon repeated download.
           In other cases it will be preserved.

           When running Wget without --NN, --nncc, or --rr, downloading
           the same file in the same directory will result in the
           original copy of file being preserved and the second
           copy being named file..11.  If that file is downloaded
           yet again, the third copy will be named file..22, and so
           on.  When --nncc is specified, this behavior is sup­
           pressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies
           of file.  Therefore, ``"no-clobber"'' is actually a
           misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering that's
           prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already pre­
           venting clobbering), but rather the multiple version
           saving that's prevented.

           When running Wget with --rr, but without --NN or --nncc, re-
           downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
           overwriting the old.  Adding --nncc will prevent this
           behavior, instead causing the original version to be
           preserved and any newer copies on the server to be
           ignored.

           When running Wget with --NN, with or without --rr, the
           decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy
           of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp
           and size of the file.  --nncc may not be specified at the
           same time as --NN.

           Note that when --nncc is specified, files with the suf­
           fixes ..hhttmmll or (yuck) ..hhttmm will be loaded from the
           local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved
           from the Web.

       --cc
       ----ccoonnttiinnuuee
           Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is
           useful when you want to finish up a download started
           by a previous instance of Wget, or by another program.
           For instance:

                   wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

           If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current direc­
           tory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of
           the remote file, and will ask the server to continue
           the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of
           the local file.

           Note that you don't need to specify this option if you
           just want the current invocation of Wget to retry
           downloading a file should the connection be lost mid­
           way through.  This is the default behavior.  --cc only
           affects resumption of downloads started prior to this
           invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still
           sitting around.

           Without --cc, the previous example would just download
           the remote file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving the truncated
           ls-lR.Z file alone.

           Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use --cc on a non-empty
           file, and it turns out that the server does not sup­
           port continued downloading, Wget will refuse to start
           the download from scratch, which would effectively
           ruin existing contents.  If you really want the down­
           load to start from scratch, remove the file.

           Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use --cc on a file
           which is of equal size as the one on the server, Wget
           will refuse to download the file and print an explana­
           tory message.  The same happens when the file is
           smaller on the server than locally (presumably because
           it was changed on the server since your last download
           attempt)---because ``continuing'' is not meaningful,
           no download occurs.

           On the other side of the coin, while using --cc, any
           file that's bigger on the server than locally will be
           considered an incomplete download and only
           "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be down­
           loaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.
           This behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for
           instance, you can use wwggeett --cc to download just the new
           portion that's been appended to a data collection or
           log file.

           However, if the file is bigger on the server because
           it's been changed, as opposed to just appended to,
           you'll end up with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of
           verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix
           of the remote file.  You need to be especially careful
           of this when using --cc in conjunction with --rr, since
           every file will be considered as an "incomplete down­
           load" candidate.

           Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if
           you try to use --cc is if you have a lame HTTP proxy
           that inserts a ``transfer interrupted'' string into
           the local file.  In the future a ``rollback'' option
           may be added to deal with this case.

           Note that --cc only works with FTP servers and with HTTP
           servers that support the "Range" header.

       ----pprrooggrreessss==type
           Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to
           use.  Legal indicators are ``dot'' and ``bar''.

           The ``dot'' indicator is used by default.  It traces
           the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot
           representing a fixed amount of downloaded data.

           When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the
           style by specifying the type as ddoott::style.  Different
           styles assign different meaning to one dot.  With the
           "default" style each dot represents 1K, there are ten
           dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The "binary"
           style has a more ``computer''-like orientation---8K
           dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which
           makes for 384K lines).  The "mega" style is suitable
           for downloading very large files---each dot represents
           64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and
           48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).

           Specifying ----pprrooggrreessss==bbaarr will draw a nice ASCII
           progress bar graphics (a.k.a ``thermometer'' display)
           to indicate retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY,
           this option will be ignored, and Wget will revert to
           the dot indicator.  If you want to force the bar indi­
           cator, use ----pprrooggrreessss==bbaarr::ffoorrccee.

       --NN
       ----ttiimmeessttaammppiinngg
           Turn on time-stamping.

       --SS
       ----sseerrvveerr--rreessppoonnssee
           Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses
           sent by FTP servers.

       ----ssppiiddeerr
           When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a
           Web spider, which means that it will not download the
           pages, just check that they are there.  You can use it
           to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:

                   wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

           This feature needs much more work for Wget to get
           close to the functionality of real WWW spiders.

       --TT sseeccoonnddss
       ----ttiimmeeoouutt==seconds
           Set the read timeout to seconds seconds.  Whenever a
           network read is issued, the file descriptor is checked
           for a timeout, which could otherwise leave a pending
           connection (uninterrupted read).  The default timeout
           is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting timeout to
           0 will disable checking for timeouts.

           Please do not lower the default timeout value with
           this option unless you know what you are doing.


       --ww seconds
       ----wwaaiitt==seconds
           Wait the specified number of seconds between the
           retrievals.  Use of this option is recommended, as it
           lightens the server load by making the requests less
           frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
           specified in minutes using the "m" suffix, in hours
           using "h" suffix, or in days using "d" suffix.

           Specifying a large value for this option is useful if
           the network or the destination host is down, so that
           Wget can wait long enough to reasonably expect the
           network error to be fixed before the retry.

       ----wwaaiittrreettrryy==seconds
           If you don't want Wget to wait between every
           retrieval, but only between retries of failed down­
           loads, you can use this option.  Wget will use linear
           backoff, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a
           given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second
           failure on that file, up to the maximum number of sec­
           onds you specify.  Therefore, a value of 10 will actu­
           ally make Wget wait up to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 sec­
           onds per file.

           Note that this option is turned on by default in the
           global wgetrc file.

       ----rraannddoomm--wwaaiitt
           Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify
           retrieval programs such as Wget by looking for statis­
           tically significant similarities in the time between
           requests. This option causes the time between requests
           to vary between 0 and 2 * wait seconds, where wait was
           specified using the --ww or ----wwaaiitt options, in order to
           mask Wget's presence from such analysis.

           A recent article in a publication devoted to develop­
           ment on a popular consumer platform provided code to
           perform this analysis on the fly.  Its author sug­
           gested blocking at the class C address level to ensure
           automated retrieval programs were blocked despite
           changing DHCP-supplied addresses.

           The ----rraannddoomm--wwaaiitt option was inspired by this ill-
           advised recommendation to block many unrelated users
           from a web site due to the actions of one.

       --YY oonn//ooffff
       ----pprrooxxyy==oonn//ooffff
           Turn proxy support on or off.  The proxy is on by
           default if the appropriate environmental variable is
           defined.

       --QQ quota
       ----qquuoottaa==quota
           Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The
           value can be specified in bytes (default), kilobytes
           (with kk suffix), or megabytes (with mm suffix).

           Note that quota will never affect downloading a single
           file.  So if you specify wwggeett --QQ1100kk
           ffttpp::////wwuuaarrcchhiivvee..wwuussttll..eedduu//llss--llRR..ggzz, all of the ls-
           lR.gz will be downloaded.  The same goes even when
           several URLs are specified on the command-line.
           However, quota is respected when retrieving either
           recursively, or from an input file.  Thus you may

       ----nnoo--ddiirreeccttoorriieess
           Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retriev­
           ing recursively.  With this option turned on, all
           files will get saved to the current directory, without
           clobbering (if a name shows up more than once, the
           filenames will get extensions ..nn).

       --xx
       ----ffoorrccee--ddiirreeccttoorriieess
           The opposite of --nndd---create a hierarchy of directo­
           ries, even if one would not have been created other­
           wise.  E.g. wwggeett --xx hhttttpp::////ffllyy..ssrrkk..ffeerr..hhrr//rroobboottss..ttxxtt
           will save the downloaded file to
           fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt.

       --nnHH
       ----nnoo--hhoosstt--ddiirreeccttoorriieess
           Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By
           default, invoking Wget with --rr hhttttpp::////ffllyy..ssrrkk..ffeerr..hhrr//
           will create a structure of directories beginning with
           fly.srk.fer.hr/.  This option disables such behavior.

       ----ccuutt--ddiirrss==number
           Ignore number directory components.  This is useful
           for getting a fine-grained control over the directory
           where recursive retrieval will be saved.

           Take, for example, the directory at
           ffttpp::////ffttpp..xxeemmaaccss..oorrgg//ppuubb//xxeemmaaccss//.  If you retrieve it
           with --rr, it will be saved locally under
           ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/.  While the --nnHH option can
           remove the ftp.xemacs.org/ part, you are still stuck
           with pub/xemacs.  This is where ----ccuutt--ddiirrss comes in
           handy; it makes Wget not ``see'' number remote direc­
           tory components.  Here are several examples of how
           ----ccuutt--ddiirrss option works.

                   No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
                   -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

                   --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
                   ...

           If you just want to get rid of the directory struc­
           ture, this option is similar to a combination of --nndd
           and --PP.  However, unlike --nndd, ----ccuutt--ddiirrss does not lose
           with subdirectories---for instance, with --nnHH ----ccuutt--
           ddiirrss==11, a beta/ subdirectory will be placed to
           xemacs/beta, as one would expect.

       --PP prefix

       ----ddiirreeccttoorryy--pprreeffiixx==prefix
           Set directory prefix to prefix.  The directory prefix
           is the directory where all other files and subdirecto­
           ries will be saved to, i.e. the top of the retrieval
           tree.  The default is .. (the current directory).

       --EE
       ----hhttmmll--eexxtteennssiioonn
           If a file of type tteexxtt//hhttmmll is downloaded and the URL
           does not end with the regexp \\..[[HHhh]][[TTtt]][[MMmm]][[LLll]]??, this
           option will cause the suffix ..hhttmmll to be appended to
           the local filename.  This is useful, for instance,
           when you're mirroring a remote site that uses ..aasspp
           pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable
           on your stock Apache server.  Another good use for
           this is when you're downloading the output of CGIs.  A
           URL like hhttttpp::////ssiittee..ccoomm//aarrttiiccllee..ccggii??2255 will be saved
           as article.cgi?25.html.

           Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-
           downloaded every time you re-mirror a site, because
           Wget can't tell that the local X.html file corresponds
           to remote URL X (since it doesn't yet know that the
           URL produces output of type tteexxtt//hhttmmll.  To prevent
           this re-downloading, you must use --kk and --KK so that
           the original version of the file will be saved as
           X.orig.

       ----hhttttpp--uusseerr==user
       ----hhttttpp--ppaasssswwdd==password
           Specify the username user and password password on an
           HTTP server.  According to the type of the challenge,
           Wget will encode them using either the "basic" (inse­
           cure) or the "digest" authentication scheme.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the
           URL itself.  For more information about security
           issues with Wget,

       ----ccaacchhee==oonn//ooffff
           When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this
           case, Wget will send the remote server an appropriate
           directive (PPrraaggmmaa:: nnoo--ccaacchhee) to get the file from the
           remote service, rather than returning the cached ver­
           sion.  This is especially useful for retrieving and
           flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

           Caching is allowed by default.

       ----ccooookkiieess==oonn//ooffff
           When set to off, disable the use of cookies.  Cookies
           are a mechanism for maintaining server-side state.
           The server sends the client a cookie using the
           "Set-Cookie" header, and the client responds with the
           same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies
           allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and
           for sites to exchange this information, some consider
           them a breach of privacy.  The default is to use cook­
           ies; however, storing cookies is not on by default.

       ----llooaadd--ccooookkiieess file
           Load cookies from file before the first HTTP
           retrieval.  file is a textual file in the format orig­
           inally used by Netscape's cookies.txt file.

           You will typically use this option when mirroring
           sites that require that you be logged in to access
           some or all of their content.  The login process typi­
           cally works by the web server issuing an HTTP cookie
           upon receiving and verifying your credentials.  The
           cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing
           that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

           Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same
           cookies your browser sends when communicating with the
           site.  This is achieved by ----llooaadd--ccooookkiieess---simply
           point Wget to the location of the cookies.txt file,
           and it will send the same cookies your browser would
           send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep
           textual cookie files in different locations:

           Netscape 4.x.
               The cookies are in ~/.netscape/cookies.txt.

           Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
               Mozilla's cookie file is also named cookies.txt,
               located somewhere under ~/.mozilla, in the direc­
               tory of your profile.  The full path usually ends
               up looking somewhat like ~/.mozilla/default/some-
               weird-string/cookies.txt.

           Internet Explorer.
               You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by
               using the File menu, Import and Export, Export
               Cookies.  This has been tested with Internet
               Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with ear­
               lier versions.

           Other browsers.
               If you are using a different browser to create
               your cookies, ----llooaadd--ccooookkiieess will only work if you
               can locate or produce a cookie file in the
               Netscape format that Wget expects.

           If you cannot use ----llooaadd--ccooookkiieess, there might still be
           an alternative.  If your browser supports a ``cookie
           manager'', you can use it to view the cookies used
           when accessing the site you're mirroring.  Write down
           the name and value of the cookie, and manually
           instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
           ``official'' cookie support:

                   wget --cookies=off --header "Cookie: I<name>=I<value>"


       ----ssaavvee--ccooookkiieess file
           Save cookies from file at the end of session.  Cookies
           whose expiry time is not specified, or those that have
           already expired, are not saved.

       ----iiggnnoorree--lleennggtthh
           Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be
           more precise) send out bogus "Content-Length" headers,
           which makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the
           document was retrieved.  You can spot this syndrome if
           Wget retries getting the same document again and
           again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
           connection has closed on the very same byte.

           With this option, Wget will ignore the "Con­
           tent-Length" header---as if it never existed.

       ----hheeaaddeerr==additional-header
           Define an additional-header to be passed to the HTTP
           servers.  Headers must contain a :: preceded by one or
           more non-blank characters, and must not contain new­
           lines.

           You may define more than one additional header by
           specifying ----hheeaaddeerr more than once.

                   wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
                        --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                          http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

           Specification of an empty string as the header value
           will clear all previous user-defined headers.

       ----pprrooxxyy--uusseerr==user
       ----pprrooxxyy--ppaasssswwdd==password
           Specify the username user and password password for
           authentication on a proxy server.  Wget will encode
           them using the "basic" authentication scheme.

       ----rreeffeerreerr==url
           Include `Referer: url' header in HTTP request.  Useful
           for retrieving documents with server-side processing
           that assume they are always being retrieved by inter­
           active web browsers and only come out properly when
           Referer is set to one of the pages that point to them.

       --ss
       ----ssaavvee--hheeaaddeerrss
           Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file,
           preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as
           the separator.

       --UU agent-string
       ----uusseerr--aaggeenntt==agent-string
           Identify as agent-string to the HTTP server.

           The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify them­
           selves using a "User-Agent" header field.  This
           enables distinguishing the WWW software, usually for
           statistical purposes or for tracing of protocol viola­
           tions.  Wget normally identifies as WWggeett//version, ver­
           sion being the current version number of Wget.

           However, some sites have been known to impose the pol­
           icy of tailoring the output according to the
           "User-Agent"-supplied information.  While conceptually
           this is not such a bad idea, it has been abused by
           servers denying information to clients other than
           "Mozilla" or Microsoft "Internet Explorer".  This
           option allows you to change the "User-Agent" line
           issued by Wget.  Use of this option is discouraged,
           unless you really know what you are doing.

       ----ddoonntt--rreemmoovvee--lliissttiinngg
           Don't remove the temporary .listing files generated by
           FTP retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw
           directory listings received from FTP servers.  Not
           removing them can be useful for debugging purposes, or
           when you want to be able to easily check on the con­
           tents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify
           that a mirror you're running is complete).

           Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename
           for this file, this is not a security hole in the sce­
           nario of a user making .listing a symbolic link to
           /etc/passwd or something and asking "root" to run Wget
           in his or her directory.  Depending on the options
           used, either Wget will refuse to write to .listing,
           making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation
           fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and
           replaced with the actual .listing file, or the listing
           will be written to a .listing.number file.

           Even though this situation isn't a problem, though,
           "root" should never run Wget in a non-trusted user's
           directory.  A user could do something as simple as
           linking index.html to /etc/passwd and asking "root" to
           run Wget with --NN or --rr so the file will be overwrit­
           ten.

       ----gglloobb==oonn//ooffff
           Turn FTP globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may
           use the shell-like special characters (wildcards),
           like **, ??, [[ and ]] to retrieve more than one file from
           the same directory at once, like:

                   wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

           By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL con­
           tains a globbing character.  This option may be used
           to turn globbing on or off permanently.

           You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being
           expanded by your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for
           a directory listing, which is system-specific.  This
           is why it currently works only with Unix FTP servers
           (and the ones emulating Unix "ls" output).

       ----ppaassssiivvee--ffttpp
           Use the passive FTP retrieval scheme, in which the
           client initiates the data connection.  This is some­
           times required for FTP to work behind firewalls.

       ----rreettrr--ssyymmlliinnkkss
           Usually, when retrieving FTP directories recursively
           and a symbolic link is encountered, the linked-to file
           is not downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link
           is created on the local filesystem.  The pointed-to
           file will not be downloaded unless this recursive
           retrieval would have encountered it separately and
           downloaded it anyway.

           When ----rreettrr--ssyymmlliinnkkss is specified, however, symbolic
           links are traversed and the pointed-to files are
           retrieved.  At this time, this option does not cause
           Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and recurse
           through them, but in the future it should be enhanced
           to do this.

           Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory)
           because it was specified on the commandline, rather
           than because it was recursed to, this option has no
           effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed in this
           case.

       --rr
       ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
           Turn on recursive retrieving.

       --ll depth
       ----lleevveell==depth
           Specify recursion maximum depth level depth.  The
           default maximum depth is 5.

       ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr
           This option tells Wget to delete every single file it
           downloads, after having done so.  It is useful for
           pre-fetching popular pages through a proxy, e.g.:

                   wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

           The --rr option is to retrieve recursively, and --nndd to
           not create directories.

           Note that ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr deletes files on the local
           machine.  It does not issue the DDEELLEE command to remote
           FTP sites, for instance.  Also note that when
           ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr is specified, ----ccoonnvveerrtt--lliinnkkss is
           ignored, so ..oorriigg files are simply not created in the
           first place.

           After the download is complete, convert the links in
           the document to make them suitable for local viewing.
           This affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any
           part of the document that links to external content,
           such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyper­
           links to non-HTML content, etc.

           Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

           ·   The links to files that have been downloaded by
               Wget will be changed to refer to the file they
               point to as a relative link.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html
               links to /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the
               link in doc.html will be modified to point to
               ....//bbaarr//iimmgg..ggiiff.  This kind of transformation works
               reliably for arbitrary combinations of directo­
               ries.

           ·   The links to files that have not been downloaded
               by Wget will be changed to include host name and
               absolute path of the location they point to.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html
               links to /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then
               the link in doc.html will be modified to point to
               http://hostname/bar/img.gif.

           Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a
           linked file was downloaded, the link will refer to its
           local name; if it was not downloaded, the link will
           refer to its full Internet address rather than pre­
           senting a broken link.  The fact that the former links
           are converted to relative links ensures that you can
           move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

           Note that only at the end of the download can Wget
           know which links have been downloaded.  Because of
           that, the work done by --kk will be performed at the end
           of all the downloads.

           When converting a file, back up the original version
           with a ..oorriigg suffix.  Affects the behavior of --NN.

       --mm
       ----mmiirrrroorr
           Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option
           turns on recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite
           recursion depth and keeps FTP directory listings.  It
           is currently equivalent to --rr --NN --ll iinnff --nnrr.

       --pp
       ----ppaaggee--rreeqquuiissiitteess
           This option causes Wget to download all the files that
           are necessary to properly display a given HTML page.
           This includes such things as inlined images, sounds,
           and referenced stylesheets.

           Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any
           requisite documents that may be needed to display it
           properly are not downloaded.  Using --rr together with
           --ll can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily dis­
           tinguish between external and inlined documents, one
           is generally left with ``leaf documents'' that are
           missing their requisites.

           For instance, say document 1.html contains an "<IMG>"
           tag referencing 1.gif and an "<A>" tag pointing to
           external document 2.html.  Say that 2.html is similar
           but that its image is 2.gif and it links to 3.html.
           Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high number.

           If one executes the command:

                   wget -r -l 2 http://I<site>/1.html

           then 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, 2.gif, and 3.html will be
           downloaded.  As you can see, 3.html is without its
           requisite 3.gif because Wget is simply counting the
           number of hops (up to 2) away from 1.html in order to
           determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with
           this command:

                   wget -r -l 2 -p http://I<site>/1.html

           all the above files and 3.html's requisite 3.gif will
           be downloaded.  Similarly,

                   wget -r -l 1 -p http://I<site>/1.html

           will cause 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, and 2.gif to be
           downloaded.  One might think that:

                   wget -r -l 0 -p http://I<site>/1.html

           would download just 1.html and 1.gif, but unfortu­
           nately this is not the case, because --ll 00 is equiva­
           lent to --ll iinnff---that is, infinite recursion.  To
           download a single HTML page (or a handful of them, all
           specified on the commandline or in a --ii URL input
           file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
           --rr and --ll:

                   wget -p http://I<site>/1.html

           Note that Wget will behave as if --rr had been speci­
           fied, but only that single page and its requisites
           will be downloaded.  Links from that page to external
           documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
           a single page and all its requisites (even if they
           exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot
           displays properly locally, this author likes to use a
           few options in addition to --pp:

                   wget -E -H -k -K -p http://I<site>/I<document>

           To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that
           Wget's idea of an external document link is any URL
           specified in an "<A>" tag, an "<AREA>" tag, or a
           "<LINK>" tag other than "<LINK REL="stylesheet">".

       --RR rejlist ----rreejjeecctt rejlist
           Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or
           patterns to accept or reject.

       --DD domain-list
       ----ddoommaaiinnss==domain-list
           Set domains to be followed.  domain-list is a comma-
           separated list of domains.  Note that it does not turn
           on --HH.

       ----eexxcclluuddee--ddoommaaiinnss domain-list
           Specify the domains that are not to be followed..

       ----ffoollllooww--ffttpp
           Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this
           option, Wget will ignore all the FTP links.

       ----ffoollllooww--ttaaggss==list
           Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute
           pairs that it considers when looking for linked docu­
           ments during a recursive retrieval.  If a user wants
           only a subset of those tags to be considered, however,
           he or she should be specify such tags in a comma-sepa­
           rated list with this option.

       --GG list
       ----iiggnnoorree--ttaaggss==list
           This is the opposite of the ----ffoollllooww--ttaaggss option.  To
           skip certain HTML tags when recursively looking for
           documents to download, specify them in a comma-sepa­
           rated list.

           In the past, the --GG option was the best bet for down­
           loading a single page and its requisites, using a com­
           mandline like:

                   wget -Ga,area -H -k -K -r http://I<site>/I<document>

           However, the author of this option came across a page
           with tags like "<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">" and came
           to the realization that --GG was not enough.  One can't
           just tell Wget to ignore "<LINK>", because then
           stylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the best bet
           for downloading a single page and its requisites is
           the dedicated ----ppaaggee--rreeqquuiissiitteess option.

       --HH
       ----ssppaann--hhoossttss
           Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive
           retrieving.

       --LL
       ----rreellaattiivvee
           Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a
           specific home page without any distractions, not even
           those from the same hosts.

       --II list
       ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirreeccttoorriieess==list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish
           to follow when downloading  Elements of list may con­
           tain wildcards.

       --XX list
       ----eexxcclluuddee--ddiirreeccttoorriieess==list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish
           to exclude from download  Elements of list may contain
           wildcards.

       --nnpp
       ----nnoo--ppaarreenntt
           Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when
           retrieving recursively.  This is a useful option,
           since it guarantees that only the files below a cer­
           tain hierarchy will be downloaded.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The examples are divided into three sections loosely based
       on their complexity.

       ·   Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:

                   wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/


       ·   But what will happen if the connection is slow, and
           the file is lengthy?  The connection will probably
           fail before the whole file is retrieved, more than
           once.  In this case, Wget will try getting the file
           until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
           default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy
           to change the number of tries to 45, to insure that
           the whole file will arrive safely:

                   wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg


       ·   Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and
           write its progress to log file log.  It is tiring to
           type ----ttrriieess, so we shall use --tt.

                   wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &

           The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that
           Wget works in the background.  To unlimit the number
           of retries, use --tt iinnff.

       ·   The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of
           login and password.

                   wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg


       ·   If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the
           directory listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.
           Try:

                   wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
                   links index.html


       AAddvvaanncceedd UUssaaggee


       ·   You have a file that contains the URLs you want to
           download?  Use the --ii switch:

                   wget -i I<file>

           If you specify -- as file name, the URLs will be read
           from standard input.

       ·   Create a five levels deep mirror image of the GNU web
           site, with the same directory structure the original
           has, with only one try per document, saving the log of
           the activities to gnulog:

                   wget -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog


       ·   The same as the above, but convert the links in the
           HTML files to point to local files, so you can view
           the documents off-line:

                   wget --convert-links -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog


       ·   Retrieve only one HTML page, but make sure that all
           the elements needed for the page to be displayed, such
           as inline images and external style sheets, are also
           downloaded.  Also make sure the downloaded page refer­
           ences the downloaded links.

                   wget -p --convert-links http://www.server.com/dir/page.html

           The HTML page will be saved to
           www.server.com/dir/page.html, and the images,
           stylesheets, etc., somewhere under www.server.com/,
           depending on where they were on the remote server.



       ·   The same as the above, but without the www.server.com/
           directory.  In fact, I don't want to have all those
           random server directories anyway---just save all those
           files under a download/ subdirectory of the current
           directory.

                   wget -p --convert-links -nH -nd -Pdownload \
                        http://www.server.com/dir/page.html


       ·   Retrieve the index.html of wwwwww..llyyccooss..ccoomm, showing the
           original server headers:

                   wget -S http://www.lycos.com/


       ·   Save the server headers with the file, perhaps for
           post-processing.

                   wget -s http://www.lycos.com/
                   more index.html


       ·   Retrieve the first two levels of wwuuaarrcchhiivvee..wwuussttll..eedduu,
           saving them to /tmp.

                   wget -r -l2 -P/tmp ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/


       ·   You want to download all the GIFs from a directory on
           an HTTP server.  You tried wwggeett
           hhttttpp::////wwwwww..sseerrvveerr..ccoomm//ddiirr//**..ggiiff, but that didn't work
           because HTTP retrieval does not support globbing.  In
           that case, use:

                   wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/

           More verbose, but the effect is the same.  --rr --ll11
           means to retrieve recursively, with maximum depth of
           1.  ----nnoo--ppaarreenntt means that references to the parent
           directory are ignored, and --AA..ggiiff means to download
           only the GIF files.  --AA ""**..ggiiff"" would have worked too.

       ·   Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when
           Wget was interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber
           the files already present.  It would be:

                   wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.org/


       ·   If you want to encode your own username and password
           to HTTP or FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax.

                   wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.server.com/.emacs


       ·   You would like the output documents to go to standard
           output instead of to files?

                   wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/

           You can also combine the two options and make
           pipelines to retrieve the documents from remote
           hotlists:

                   wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -


       VVeerryy AAddvvaanncceedd UUssaaggee


       ·   If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
           subdirectories), use ----mmiirrrroorr (--mm), which is the
           shorthand for --rr --ll iinnff --NN.  You can put Wget in the
           crontab file asking it to recheck a site each Sunday:

                   crontab
                   0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog


       ·   In addition to the above, you want the links to be
           converted for local viewing.  But, after having read
           this manual, you know that link conversion doesn't
           play well with timestamping, so you also want Wget to
           back up the original HTML files before the conversion.
           Wget invocation would look like this:

                   wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted  \
                        http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog


       ·   But you've also noticed that local viewing doesn't
           work all that well when HTML files are saved under
           extensions other than ..hhttmmll, perhaps because they were
           served as index.cgi.  So you'd like Wget to rename all
           the files served with content-type tteexxtt//hhttmmll to
           name.html.

                   wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted \
                        --html-extension -o /home/me/weeklog        \
                        http://www.gnu.org/

           Or, with less typing:

                   wget -m -k -K -E http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

       You are welcome to send bug reports about GNU Wget to
       <"bug-wget@gnu.org">.

       Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to
       follow a few simple guidelines.

       1.  Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see
           really is a bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If
           Wget does not behave as documented, it's a bug.  If
           things work strange, but you are not sure about the
           way they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug.

       2.  Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as
           possible.  E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading wwggeett
           --rrll00 --kkKKEE --tt55 --YY00 hhttttpp::////yyooyyooddyynnee..ccoomm --oo //ttmmpp//lloogg, you
           should try to see if the crash is repeatable, and if
           will occur with a simpler set of options.  You might
           even try to start the download at the page where the
           crash occurred to see if that page somehow triggered
           the crash.

           Also, while I will probably be interested to know the
           contents of your .wgetrc file, just dumping it into
           the debug message is probably a bad idea.  Instead,
           you should first try to see if the bug repeats with
           .wgetrc moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out
           that .wgetrc settings affect the bug, mail me the rel­
           evant parts of the file.

       3.  Please start Wget with --dd option and send the log (or
           the relevant parts of it).  If Wget was compiled with­
           out debug support, recompile it.  It is much easier to
           trace bugs with debug support on.

       4.  If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g.
           "gdb `which wget` core" and type "where" to get the
           backtrace.
