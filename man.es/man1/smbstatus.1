NAME
       smbstatus - report on current Samba connections

SYNOPSIS
       smbstatus  [  -P ]  [ -b ]  [ -d ]  [ -L ]  [ -p ]  [ -S ]
       [ -s <configuration file> ]  [ -u <username> ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       smbstatus is a very simple program  to  list  the  current
       Samba connections.

OPTIONS
       -P     If  samba  has  been  compiled  with  the profiling
              option, print only the contents  of  the  profiling
              shared memory area.

       -b     gives brief output.

       -d     gives verbose output.

       -L     causes smbstatus to only list locks.

       -p     print a list of  smbd(8)processes and exit.  Useful
              for scripting.

       -S     causes smbstatus to only list shares.

       -s <configuration file>
              The default configuration file name  is  determined
              at  compile  time.  The file specified contains the
              configuration details required by the  server.  See
              smb.conf(5) for more information.

       -u <username>
              selects information relevant to username only.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
