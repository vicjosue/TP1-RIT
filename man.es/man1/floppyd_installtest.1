Name
       floppyd_installtest  -  tests whether floppyd is installed
       and running



Note of warning
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation,  and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this  man  page  for
       details.


Description
       Floppyd_installtest is used to check for the presence of a
       running floppyd daemon. This is usefull,  if  you  have  a
       small  frontend script to mtools, which decides whether to
       use floppyd or not.

       floppyd_installtest [-f]  Connect-String

       If the -f option is specified, floppyd_installtest does  a
       full  X-Cookie  authentication  and complains if this does
       not work.

       The connect-String has the format described in  the  flop­
       pyd-section: hostname:displaynumber[/baseport]

Viewing the texi doc
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

              A     premade     html    can    be    found    at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'     and      also      at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To  generate  an  info copy (browsable using emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
