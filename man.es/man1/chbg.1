SYNOPSIS
       chbg [OPTIONS..] [IMAGE FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       chbg  is  a simple program for managing & changing desktop
       pictures that  can  also  be  used  as  a  xscreensaver(1)
       client.

OPTIONS
       -v     Prints version number and exit.

              Wildcard pattern for picture selection in recursion
              through  directories.   When  you  want to use more

       -dshaders list
              List  of  disabled  background shading effects when
              randomizing.  This option allows you to  omit  some
              picture  changing  effects, which you don't like or
              which doesn't suit your needs.

       -notooltips

       -grad_dir dir
              Directory  where  GIMP  gradients can be located on
              your system.  As default following directories  are
              scanned to search gradient files.
               /usr/share/gimp/gradients
               /usr/share/gimp-1.1/gradients
               /usr/share/gimp-1.2/gradients
               /opt/share/gimp/gradients
               /opt/share/gimp-1.1/gradients
               /opt/share/gimp-1.2/gradients
               /usr/local/share/gimp/gradients
               /usr/local/share/gimp-1.1/gradients
               /usr/local/share/gimp-1.2/gradients
               When   GIMP  gradient  files  are  elsewhere  than
              default directories, use this option to force  ChBg
              to  load  GIMP gradients from your directory.  When
              ChBg can't find  gradient,  it  will  automatically
              disable all gradient shading features.

       -use_grad
              Enable the use of GIMP gradients for coloring back­
              ground shading effects.

       -grad n
              Set gradient number to use for coloring  background
              shading effects. 0 means random.

       -remember
              Allow  remembering  of  last shown picture. This is
              very usable when you maintain  very  long  list  of
              pictures  and next time when you run ChBg with same
              scenario file you want to continue from that  point
              where you left ChBg last time.
               WARNING:  this feature requires to have saved sce­
              narion and that scenario must be writable by  user.

       -enlightenment
              If  you are running Enlightenment window manager on
              your desktop, you may want to use its functions  to
              manage  desktop background images.  When you enable
              this option, ChBg will try to use its capabilities.
              This  works  only with enlightenment 0.16 and above
              using eesh program.

       -once  This option have only  effect  when  used  directly
              from  commandline  and  ChBg  will  run without GUI
              environment. When this option is  used,  ChBg  will
              run only one cycle of background changing and after
              that it will exit. This is usable if  you  want  to
              change  background  once  per  session (for example
              from  .xinitrc  or  .xsession  startup  scripts  or
              Gnome/KDE session managers).

       -thumb type
              You  can  use this option when you just want to use
              directly one of ChBg's thumbnail previews. As  type
              use one of all/dir/page.

       -use_tiles
              This  option  activates coloring of shading effects
              by tiled pixmaps.  To activate it fully,  you  must
              also use -tile option.

       -tile file
              With  this option you can set picture which will be
              used  as  tile  for  coloring  background   shading
              effects  or  just  plain drawn on backround when no
              shading effect will be used. To activate this  fea­
              ture you must also use -use_tiles option, otherwise
              it won't work. You can also set the file  parameter
              to  random  and  ChBg  will  select randomly one of
              tiles set by -add_tile option.

       -add_tile file
              Use this option, when  you  want  to  use  multiple
              tiles  for  coloring  background  shading  effects.
              Parameter file can be one picture file or directory
              with  pictures,  which  will be scanned recursively
              for  pictures.  See  also  -tile   and   -use_tiles
              options.

       -use_banners
              This  options  activates  use of banner pictures on
              top of normal background pictures. Banner  pictures
              will  be  drawn  in  mode similar to smart mode for
              normal background pictures. To fully use this  fea­
              ture,  you must also set banner pictures with -ban­
              ner and or -add_banner options.

       -banner file
              Parameter file of this options sets particular ban­
              ner  picture  file or when it is set to "random" it
              can randomly select one banner  from  banner  files
              added by -add_banner option.

       -add_banner file
              Set  a  directory  where to find banner pictures or
              file which will be use as a banner.

       -banner_mode mode
              ChBg allows various drawing modes for drawing  ban­
              ner  on top of background.  You can set one of nor­
              mal, average, lighten,  darken,  divide,  multiply,
              multiplybg,   multiplyfg,   add,  subtractbg,  sub­
              tractfg, grayscale, bumpmap, bumpmapself or  number
              0-13.

       -banner_xpos pos
              Horizontal  position of banner on the screen. It is
              similar to -xpos.

       -banner_ypos pos
              Vertical position of banner on the  screen.  It  is
              similar to -ypos.

       -banner_max_grow ratio
              Maximal  banner growing ratio. This option is equal
              to -max_grow option, it is just applied to banners.

       -banner_max_size nr
              Maximal  allowed area of screen taken by banner. It
              is equal to -max_size option.

       -to_file
              Render the composite picture directly to  file.  To
              work    fully    -out_file,   -out_file_width   and
              -out_file_height have to be given.   Fileformat  of
              the rendered picture is PNG.

       -out_file filename
              Set the composite picture's filename.

       -out_file_width n
              Set composite picture's width.
               (Default value 0 means that ChBg takes size from X
              root window.)

       -out_file_height n
              Set composite picture's height.
               (Default value 0 means that ChBg takes size from X
              root window.)

              Force Nautilus to use ChBg generated picture.

       -send_expose
