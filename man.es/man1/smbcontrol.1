NAME
       smbcontrol - send messages to smbd or nmbd processes

SYNOPSIS
       smbcontrol [ -i ]

       smbcontrol  [ destination ]  [ message-type ]  [ parameter
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       smbcontrol is a very small program, which  sends  messages
       to an smbd(8)or an nmbd(8)daemon running on the system.

OPTIONS
       -i     Run  interactively. Individual commands of the form
              destination message-type parameters can be  entered
              on  STDIN. An empty command line or a "q" will quit
              the program.

       destination
              One of nmbd smbd or a process ID.

              The smbd destination causes the message to  "broad­
              cast" to all smbd daemons.

              The  nmbd destination causes the message to be sent
              to the nmbd daemon specified in the nmbd.pid  file.

              If  a  single  process  ID is given, the message is
              sent to only that process.

       message-type
              One of: close-share, debug, force-election, ping  ,
              profile,   debuglevel,  profilelevel,  or  printer-
              notify.

              The close-share message-type  sends  a  message  to
              smbd  which  will then close the client connections
              to the named share. Note that this  doesn't  affect
              client  connections  to any other shares. This mes­
              sage-type takes an argument of the share  name  for
              which  client connections will be close, or the "*"
              character  which  will  close  all  currently  open
              shares.  This message can only be sent to smbd.

              The debug message-type allows the debug level to be
              set to the value specified by the  parameter.  This
              can be sent to any of the destinations.

              The force-election message-type can only be sent to
              the nmbd destination. This message causes the  nmbd
              daemon to force a new browse master election.

              The  ping  message-type  sends the number of "ping"
              messages specified by the parameter and  waits  for
              the  same number of reply "pong" messages. This can
              be sent to any of the destinations.

              The profile message-type sends a message to an smbd
              to   change  the  profile  settings  based  on  the
              parameter. The parameter can be  "on"  to  turn  on
              profile stats collection, "off" to turn off profile
              stats collection, "count" to enable only collection
              of  count  stats  (time  stats  are  disabled), and
              "flush" to zero the current profile stats. This can
              be sent to any of the destinations.

              The  debuglevel message-type sends a "request debug
              level" message. The current debug level setting  is
              returned  by  a  "debuglevel"  message. This can be
              sent to any of the destinations.

              The profilelevel message-type sends a "request pro­
              file level" message. The current profile level set­
              ting is returned by a "profilelevel" message.  This
              can be sent to any of the destinations.

              The  printer-notify message-type sends a message to
              smbd which in turn sends a printer  notify  message
              to  any  Windows NT clients connected to a printer.
              This message-type takes an argument of the  printer
              name  to send notify messages to.  This message can
              only be sent to smbd.

              The close-share message-type  sends  a  message  to
              smbd  which forces smbd to close the share that was
              specified as an argument. This may be useful if you
              made changes to the access controls on the share.

       parameters
              any parameters required for the message-type

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
