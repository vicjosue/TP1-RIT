SQ(1)                                                       SQ(1)



NAME
       sq  - squeeze a sorted word list unsq - unsqueeze a sorted
       word list

SYNOPSIS
       sq < infile > outfile

       unsq < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       sq compresses a sorted list of words (a dictionary).   For
       example:
              sort   /usr/share/dict/words  |  sq  |  compress  >
              words.sq.Z
       will compress dict by about a factor of 4.

       unsq uncompress the output of sq.  For example:
              compress -d < words.sq.Z | unsq | sort -f -o words
       will uncompress a dictionary compressed with sq.

       The squeezing is achieved by eliminating common  prefixes,
       and  replacing  them with a single character which encodes
       the number of characters shared with the  preceding  word.
       The  prefix  size is encoded as a single printable charac­
       ter: 0-9 represent 0-9, A-Z represent 10-35, and a-z  rep­
       resent 36-61.
