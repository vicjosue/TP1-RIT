NAME
       taumix - aumix wrapper for X


DESCRIPTION
       taumix  is  a wrapper to select one of rxvt, xterm, kterm,
       or one of the other possible xterm "clones", and to launch
       that  with aumix running in it. For some X terminal emula­
       tors an aumix colour scheme file is  used  to  generate  a
       sensible  display (for example, rxvt and xterm behave dif­
       ferently with respect to the handling of colours).

       This script was  originally  intended  for  use  from  the
       Debian  menu system, but may also be invoked manually from
       a shell.  The GTK+ interface to aumix  largely  supersedes
       it.
