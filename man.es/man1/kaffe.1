NAME
       kaffe - a virtual machine to execute Java(tm) bytecode

SYNOPSIS
       kaffe  [-help] [-version] [-ss size] [-ms size] [-mx size]
       [-classpath   path]   [-addclasspath   path]   [-noverify]
       [-Dproperty=value]  [-v] [-verbosegc] [-verbosejit] [-ver­
       bosemem] [-jar] [-vmdebug flag{,flag}]  classname

DESCRIPTION
       kaffe executes classfile containing Java bytecode,  either
       as a pure bytecode interpreter, or by doing "just-in-time"
       code  conversion  from  the  abstract  code  to  the  host
       machine's native code.

OPTIONS
       -help  Give a short usage message.

       -version
              Print the version number.

       -ss size
              Set the maximum stack size to size

       -mx size
              Set the maximum heap size to size

       -ms size
              Set the initial heap size to size

       -classpath path
              Set   the  path  which  is  searched  for  compiled
              classes, e.g.  /usr/share/kaffe

       -addclasspath path
              Appends the given path  to  the  current  classpath
              setting.  Multiple  instances  of  this flag may be
              given.

       -noverify
              Do not verify any bytecode.

       -Dproperty=value
              Set a property to a given value.

       -jar   Executable is a JAR file.

       -v     Enable verbose output.

       -verbosegc
              Print message during garbage collection.

       -verbosemem
              Print detailed memory allocation statistics.

       -verbosejit
              Print message during JIT code generation.

       -vmdebug flag{,flag}
              Enable VM debugging. Set ``-vmdebug  list''  for  a
              list.

CLASS
       classname
              Java  class  name to invoke.  Note that this is not
              the filename.

ENVIRONMENT
       CLASSPATH
              A colon-separated list of directories in  which  to
              search for .class files.

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH
              A  colon-separated  list of directories in which to
              search for libraries.  See  ld.so(1)  for  details.
              This  needs  to  be set if Kaffe's shared libraries
              are installed in a location not part of the dynamic
              loader's default search path.
