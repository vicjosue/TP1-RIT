NAME
       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SYNOPSIS
       soelim [ -Cv ] [ -Idir ] [ files... ]

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between the -I command
       line option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form

              .so file

       by the contents of file.  It is useful if  files  included
       with  so need to be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim should
       be invoked with the -s option of groff.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the  leading
       dot  and  the two characters `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only
       groff interprets the .so request (and soelim ignores  it).

OPTIONS
       -C     Recognize  .so  even  when  followed by a character
              other than space or newline.

       -Idir  This option may be used to specify a  directory  to
              search  for  files  (both those on the command line
              and those named in .so lines).  The current  direc­
              tory  is always searched first.  This option may be
              specified more than once, the directories  will  be
              searched  in  the  order  specified.   No directory
              search is performed for files  specified  using  an
              absolute path.

       -v     Print the version number.
