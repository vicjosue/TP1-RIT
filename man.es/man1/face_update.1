FACE_UPDATE(1L)                                   FACE_UPDATE(1L)



NAME
       faces - automatic faces database update script.

SYNOPSIS
       face_update [ -o ] [ -w ]

DESCRIPTION
       face_update  is  a shell script for automatically updating
       the faces database with "on-the-fly" faces. When faces  is
       run with the -U option, every time that a new "on-the-fly"
       face is found, it is mailed to a special mail alias  which
       by  default  is facemaker.  There would be a special entry
       in the /etc/aliases file for facemaker.  Something like:

            "|/usr/local/bin/face_update"

       This mail message has a certain format. The  Subject  line
       contains  the file in the database to be updated. The body
       of the mail message is 48 lines  in  Blit  ikon  (48x48x1)
       format.  Depending  upon  command  line  options, this new
       faces is included in the faces database.  face_update will
       also  perform  various tests on the mail message to ensure
       it is a valid update.

       An entry will be written in the /var/log/facelog log  file
       upon  completion.  This entry will consist of a timestamp,
       the name of the user who sent the update,  the  ikon  that
       was  updated, and the status of the update (whether it was
       successful or not).

       Note that the log file (  /var/log/facelog)  needs  to  be
       created and owned by daemon with permissions of 0644.

OPTIONS
       -o     This  is  to  allow ikons to be stored in the "old"
              style format, where the username was the ikon,  and
              not a directory where the icons were kept.

       -w     If  the  given  ikon  is  already  present  in  the
              database, this option will allow it to be overwrit­
              ten. By default this doesn't happen.

FILES
       /var/log/facelog
              log file for all ikon updates.
