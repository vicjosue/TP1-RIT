DESCRIPTION
       Dia is used to create diagrams. Dia has a number of  basic
       tools,  like lines and boxes but can also dynamically load
       "sheets". A sheet is a collection of tools that  are  used
       in a certain type of diagram.

       Most  diagram  objects  in Dia has "handles". Lines can be
       connected to these handles and this way  graph  structures
       can  be formed. When objects are moved or resized the con­
       nections will follow the objects.

       Diagrams drawn in Dia can be exported PostScript.
