NAME
       MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

SYNOPSIS
       Not  a command -- see the SEE ALSO section for usable com­
       mands.

DESCRIPTION
       MIME is the official proposed standard format for extended
       Internet  electronic  mail.  The MIME format permits email
       to include enhanced text, graphics, audio, and more, in  a
       standardized  and  interoperable  manner.  If you send and
       receive mail with a MIME-compliant mail system,  you  will
       be able to send and receive far more than ASCII text.

       Various  different  people  and companies are implementing
       MIME-compliant software.  This man page was  provided,  by
       user  request,  as part of the freely-available "metamail"
       distribution from Bellcore.  Metamail provides a  complete
       MIME  implementation, but there may well be others at your
       site, too.  The "SEE ALSO"  section  only  refers  to  the
       tools that came as part of the metamail distribution.
