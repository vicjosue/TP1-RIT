NAME
       grotty - groff driver for typewriter-like devices

SYNOPSIS
       grotty [ -hfbuodBUv ] [ -Fdir ] [ files...  ]

       It  is  possible  to have whitespace between the -F option
       and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grotty translates the output of  GNU  troff  into  a  form
       suitable  for  typewriter-like  devices.   Normally grotty
       should be invoked  by  using  the  groff  command  with  a
       -Tascii,  -Tkoi8-r,  -Tlatin1  or  -Tutf8  option on ASCII
       based systems, and with -Tcp1047 on  EBCDIC  based  hosts.
       If  no  files  are  given,  grotty  will read the standard
       input.  A filename of - will also cause grotty to read the
       standard input.  Output is written to the standard output.

       Normally grotty  prints  a  bold  character  c  using  the
       sequence  `c  BACKSPACE c' and a italic character c by the
       sequence `_ BACKSPACE c'.  These  sequences  can  be  dis­
       played on a terminal by piping through ul(1).  Pagers such
       as more(1) or less(1)  are  also  able  to  display  these
       sequences.   Use either -B or -U when piping into less(1);
       use -b when piping into more(1).  There is no need to fil­
       ter  the  output through col(1) since grotty never outputs
       reverse line feeds.

       The font description file may contain a command

              internalname n

       where n is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in n is  set,
       then the font will be treated as an italic font; if the 02
       bit is set, then it will be treated as a bold  font.   The
       code  field  in  the font description field gives the code
       which will be used to output the character.  This code can
       also be used in the \N escape sequence in troff.

OPTIONS
       -Fdir  Prepend  directory  dir/devname  to the search path
              for font and device description files; name is  the
              name  of the device, usually ascii, koi8-r, latin1,
              utf8, or cp1047.

       -h     Use  horizontal  tabs  in  the  output.   Tabs  are
              assumed to be set every 8 columns.

       -f     Use  form feeds in the output.  A form feed will be
              output at the end of each page that has  no  output
              on its last line.

       -b     Suppress  the  use of overstriking for bold charac­
              ters.

       -u     Suppress the use of underlining for italic  charac­
              ters.

       -B     Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.

       -U     Use only underlining for bold-italic characters.

       -o     Suppress  overstriking  (other  than  for  bold  or
              underlined characters).

       -d     Ignore all \D commands.  Without this  grotty  will
              render  \D'l...'   commands  that  have at least at
              least one zero argument (and so are either horizon­
              tal or vertical) using -, | and + characters.

       -v     Print the version number.

BUGS
       grotty is intended only for simple documents.

       There is no support for fractional horizontal or  vertical
       motions.

       There  is no support for \D commands other than horizontal
       and vertical lines.

       Characters above the first line (ie with a vertical  posi­
       tion of 0) cannot be printed.
