NAME
       ppmtopjxl  - convert a portable pixmap into an HP PaintJet
       XL PCL file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopjxl [-nopack] [-gamma <n> ] [-presentation]  [-dark]
       [-diffuse]  [-cluster]  [-dither]  [-xshift <s> ] [-yshift
       <s> ] [-xshift <s> ] [-yshift <s> ] [-xsize|-width|-xscale
       <s> ] [-ysize|-height|-yscale <s> ] [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap  as input.  Produces a PCL file
       suitable for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as out­
       put.

       The  generated file is not suitable for printing on a nor­
       mal PrintJet printer.  The -nopack option generates a file
       which does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method.
       This file might be printable on a normal PaintJet  printer
       (not an XL).

       The -gamma option sets the gamma correction for the image.
       The useful range for the PaintJet XL is approximately  0.6
       to 1.5.

       The  rendering  algorithm  used  for images can be altered
       with the -dither, -cluster, and  -diffuse  options.  These
       options   select   ordered  dithering,  clustered  ordered
       dithering, or error  diffusion  respectively.   The  -dark
       option  can  be  used  to enhance images with a dark back­
       ground when they are reduced in size.   The  -presentation
       option turns on presentation mode, in which two passes are
       made over the paper to increase ink density.  This  should
       be used only for images where quality is critical.


       The  image can be resized by setting the -xsize and -ysize
       options. The parameter  to  either  of  these  options  is
       interpreted  as  the  number  of  dots to set the width or
       height to, but an optional  dimension  of  `pt'  (points),
       `dp'  (decipoints),  `in'  (inches), or `cm' (centimetres)
       may be appended.  If only one dimension is specified,  the
       other will be scaled appropriately.

       The  options -width and -height are synonyms of -xsize and
       -ysize.

       The -xscale and -yscale options can alternatively be  used
       to scale the image by a simple factor.


       The  image can be shifted on the page by using the -xshift
       and -yshift options. These move the  image  the  specified
       dimensions right and down.
