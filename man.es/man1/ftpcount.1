NAME
       ftpcount  -  show  current  number of connections for each
       proftpd server configuration

SYNOPSIS
       ftpcount

DESCRIPTION
       The ftpcount command shows the current number  of  connec­
       tions  per  server and virtualhost/anonymous configuration
       defined in the proftpd.conf file.  Connections spawned  by
       inetd  are counted seperately from those created by a mas­
       ter proftpd standalone server.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display a short usage  description,  including
                   all available options.

       -p,--path scoreboard-path
                   Specify  the  full  path to proftpd's run-time
                   scoreboard files (configured  via  the  Score­
                   boardPath   directive  in  proftpd.conf).   If
                   proftpd's default directory has  been  changed
                   via  this  directive,  ftpcount must either be
                   recompiled or this  option  must  be  used  in
                   order to find proftpd's scoreboard.
