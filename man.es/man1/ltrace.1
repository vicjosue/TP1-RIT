NAME
       ltrace - A library call tracer


SYNOPSIS
       ltrace  [-dfiLSrtttChV] [-a column] [-s strsize] [-o file­
       name] [-n nr] [-l filename] [-u username] [-p pid] ... [-e
       expr]   [--debug]  [--demangle]  [--align=column]  [--out­
       put=filename] [--indent=nr] [--library=filename]  [--help]
       [--version] [command [arg ...]]


DESCRIPTION
       ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command
       until it exits.  It intercepts  and  records  the  dynamic
       library calls which are called by the executed process and
       the signals which are received by that  process.   It  can
       also  intercept and print the system calls executed by the
       program.

       Its use is very similar to strace(1).


OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Increase the debugging level.

       -f     Trace child processes as they are created  by  cur­
              rently  traced processes as a result of the fork(2)
              or clone(2)  system  calls.   The  new  process  is
              attached as soon as its pid is known.

       -i     Print  the  instruction  pointer at the time of the
              library call.

       -L     DON'T display library calls (use  it  with  the  -S
              option).

       -S     Display system calls as well as library calls

       -r     Print  a  relative  timestamp with each line of the
              trace.  This records the  time  difference  between
              the beginning of successive lines.

       -t     Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

       -tt    If given twice, the time printed will  include  the
              microseconds.

       -ttt   If  given thrice, the time printed will include the
              microseconds  and  the  leading  portion  will   be
              printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

       -C, --demangle
              Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-
              level names.  Besides removing any  initial  under­
              score prepended by the system, this makes C++ func­
              tion names readable.

       -a, --align column
              Align return values in a  secific  column  (default
              column 50).

       -s     Specify  the  maximum  string  size  to  print (the
              default is 32).

       -o, --output filename
              Write the trace output to the file filename  rather
              than to stderr.

       -n, --indent nr
              Indent trace output by nr number of spaces for each
              new nested call. Using this option makes  the  pro­
              gram flow visualization easy to follow.

       -l, --library filename
              Display  only  the  symbols included in the library
              filename.  Up to 20 library names can be  specified
              with several instances of this option.

       -u username
              Run command with the userid, groupid and supplemen­
              tary groups of username.  This option is only  use­
              ful  when  running  as root and enables the correct
              execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.

       -p pid Attach to the process with the process ID  pid  and
              begin tracing.

       -e expr
              A qualifying expression which modifies which events
              to trace.  The format of the expression is:
              [!]value1[,value2]...
              where the values are the functions to trace.  Using
              an exclamation mark negates the set of values.  For
              example -e printf means to trace  only  the  printf
              library  call.   By  contrast,  -e !printf means to
              trace every library call except printf.

              Note that some shells use the exclamation point for
              history  expansion;  even  inside quoted arguments.
              If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a
              backslash.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number of ltrace and exit.


BUGS
       It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).

       Manual page and documentation are not very up-to-date.

       Option -f sometimes fails to trace some children.

       It only works on Linux/i386, Linux/m68k, and Linux/arm

       Only ELF32 binaries are supported

       If  you like to report a bug, send a notice to the author,
       or use the bug(1) program if  you  are  under  the  Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution.
