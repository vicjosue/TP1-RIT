NAME
       pktopbm  -  convert  packed (PK) format font into portable
       bitmap(s)

SYNOPSIS
       pktopbm pkfile[.pk] [ -x width ] [ -y height  ]  [-c  num]
       pbmfile ...

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  packed  (PK)  font  file  as input, and produces
       portable bitmaps as output. If the filename  "-"  is  used
       for  any  of  the filenames, the standard input stream (or
       standard output where appropriate) will be used. If either
       the  width or height is specified, this value will be used
       for all bitmaps produced. Also if one or both  values  are
       specified,  the  bitmap will be relocated with the hoffset
       and voffset given in the pkfile.  The  basepoint  will  be
       placed  in  the  lower  left  corner  of the bitmap if the
       bitmap is bigger than the specified size it will be  trun­
       cated at the top or right.

OPTIONS
       -c num Sets  the character number of the next bitmap writ­
              ten to num.

       -x width
              Sets the width of the bitmap.

       -y width
              Sets the height of the bitmap.
