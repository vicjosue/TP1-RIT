NAME
     cal - displays a calendar

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-mjy13] [[month] year]

DESCRIPTION
     Cal displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the cur­
     rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:

     -1      Display single month output (use if cal was built with -3 as
             default to get older traditional output)

     -3      Display prev/current/next month output (use if cal was built with
             traditional -1 as default to get newer improved output)

     -m      Display Monday as the first day of the week.  (The default is
             Sunday.)

     -j      Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -y      Display a calendar for the current year.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed; note
     the year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will not display a calendar
     for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.  If no
     parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.

     A year starts on Jan 1.

     The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd
     of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the reforma­
     tion (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)  Ten
     days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal­
     endar for that month is a bit unusual.
