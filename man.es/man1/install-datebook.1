NAME
       install-datebook  -  installs  a new datebook entries in a
       Palm Device

SYNOPSIS
       install-date /dev/cua? filename [filename filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       install-datebook allows the user  to  write  one  or  more
       datebook  entries  from  one  or  more  source files. Once
       install-datebook is started, the user must invoke  HotSync
       on the target device.

       The  format  of source file contains one datebook entry on
       line, containing four tab separated fields. The fields are
       start  date/time,  end  date/time, alarm settings, and the
       description of datebook entry.  This program  doesn't  yet
       support repeted entries. The date and time must be in for­
       mat understand by parsedate.y. At least following  formats
       are understood:

       August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300
       1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300

       If the either one of the date and time fields is empty the
       entry is installed without time. If  the  alarm  field  is
       entry  the  entry is installed without alarms. Alarm field
       can contain number followed by "m" (minutes), "h" (hours),
       or  "d"  (days).  Here  are some complete example lines ("
       <TAB> "= tab, " <NL> " = newline):

       1997/08/11 0800  GMT+300  <TAB>  1997/08/11  0900  GMT+300
       <TAB> <TAB> IETF Registration <NL>
       August  11,  1997  0900 GMT+300 <TAB> August 11, 1997 0930
       GMT+300 <TAB> 2m <TAB> Introductions <NL>

   OPTIONS
       none

USEAGE
       The program will connect to a target, and write  the  file
       or files given on the command line.

BUGS
       If  no timezone is given to date the install-datebook will
       assume the time is in GMT and it will convert it to local­
       time. If you don't want to write timezone to all begin and
       end times set the TZ environment variable  to  GMT  before
       running this program.
