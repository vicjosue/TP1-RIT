NAME
       yuvplittoppm  -  convert  a  Y-  an U- and a V-file into a
       portable pixmap.

SYNOPSIS
       yuvsplittoppm basename width height [-ccir601]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads three  files,  containing  the  YUV  components,  as
       input.   These  files are basename.Y, basename.U and base­
       name.V .  Produces a portable pixmap on stdout.

       Since the YUV files are raw files,  the  dimensions  width
       and height must be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       -ccir601
              Assumes  that  the YUV triplets are scaled into the
              smaller range of  the  CCIR  601  (MPEG)  standard.
              Else, the JFIF (JPEG) standard is assumed.
