DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-configure is a program to establish and configure
       print queues, drivers, spoolers, etc  using  the  foomatic
       database and companion filters.

       It  also  comprises  half  of  a  programatic API for user
       tools: you can learn  and  control  everything  about  the
       static  properties  of print queues here.  With the sister
       program foomatic-printjob, you can do  everything  related
       to print queue dynamic state: submit jobs, and query, can­
       cel, reorder, and redirect them.


   Options
       -n queuename
                 Configure this print queue

       -N Name/Description
                 Use this proper human-readable name/description

       -L Location
                 Short phrase describing this printer's location

       -c connection
                 Printer is connected thusly (ex file:/dev/lp0)

       -d driver Foomatic  database  name  for  desired   printer
                 driver

       -p printer
                 Foomatic id for printer

       -s spooler
                 Explicit  spooler  type  (cups, lpd, lprng, pdq,
                 ppr, direct)

       -o option=value
                 Set the default of option to value

       -o option Turn on option by default

       --oldppd  Use the old  CUPS-O-Matic  PPD  files  for  CUPS
                 queues (default are the PPD-O-Matic PPDs)

       -D        Set  this  queue as the default queue (just give
                 -n queuename)

       -R        Remove this whole queue entirely (just  give  -n
                 queuename)

       -C [ sourcespooler ] sourcequeue
                 Copy sourcequeue from sourcespooler (or the cur­
                 rent one if sourcespooler is not given) into the
                 queue  given  by  -n  queuename  (of the current
                 spooler).

       -Q        Query existing configuration (gives XML summary)

       -r        List also remotely defined queues (CUPS only)

       -P [ index ]
                 Get  Perl  dump  of  current configuration (as a
                 Perl array named  QUEUES,  the  first  index  is
                 index, or zero if index is not given)

       -O        Print  XML Overview of all known printer/drivers
                 (this shows also the Foomatic IDs of the  print­
                 ers)

       -X        Print  XML  data for -p printer and/or -d driver
                 object

       -q        Run quietly

BUGS
       foomatic-configure currently cannot handle printcap  files
       in  the lprng style.  As lprng can use BSD style printcaps
       this is not much of a problem, as long as  the  GUI  based
       print  manager  lprngtool  is  not  used.   The difference
       between those formats is, that BSD style requires continu­
       ation  lines  in  printer  definitions  to be ended with a
       colon and the newline character to be escaped with a back­
       slash.  Lprng has no such restriction.

       To  use a printcap file generated or edited with lprngtool
       with foomatic-configure it is necessary to add :\  to  the
       end  of all but the last line of every printer definition,
       just as shown below:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp
       #alternate names
        |lp2|lp3
        |Example of a printer
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100
        :

       must be converted to:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp\
        |lp2|lp3\
        |Example of a printer\
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp:\
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100:
