NAME
       montage  -  creates a composite image by combining several
       separate images


SYNOPSIS
       montage [ options ...] file [ [  options  ...]  file  ...]
       output_file


DESCRIPTION
       montage  creates  a  composite  image by combining several
       separate images. The images are  tiled  on  the  composite
       image with the name of the image optionally appearing just
       below the individual tile.

       The composite image is constructed in the  following  man­
       ner.  First,  each  image  specified  on the command line,
       except for the last, is scaled to  fit  the  maximum  tile
       size. The maximum tile size by default is 120x120.  It can
       be modified with the -geometry command line argument or  X
       resource. See Options for more information on command line
       arguments. See X(1) for more information on  X  resources.
       Note  that  the maximum tile size need not be a square. To
       respect the aspect ratio of each image  append  ~  to  the
       geometry specification.

       Next  the  composite  image  is initialized with the color
       specified by the -background command line  argument  or  X
       resource.  The  width and height of the composite image is
       determined by the title specified, the maximum tile  size,
       the  number  of  tiles  per row, the tile border width and
       height, the image border width, and the label height.  The
       number  of  tiles per row specifies how many images are to
       appear in each row of the composite image. The default  is
       to  have 5 tiles in each row and 4 tiles in each column of
       the composite.  A specific value is specified with  -tile.
       The  tile  border  width  and height, and the image border
       width defaults to the value of  the  X  resource  -border­
       width.  It can be changed with the -borderwidth or -geome­
       try command line argument or X resource. The label  height
       is  determined by the font you specify with the -font com­
       mand line argument or X resource. If you do not specify  a
       font,  a  font is chosen that allows the name of the image
       to fit the maximum width of a tiled area.  The label  col­
       ors  is  determined  by  the -background and -fill command
       line argument or X resource. Note, that if the  background
       and pen colors are the same, labels will not appear.

       Initially,  the composite image title is placed at the top
       if one is specified (refer to -fill). Next, each image  is
       set  onto  the  composite  image, surrounded by its border
       color, with its name centered just below it. The  individ­
       ual  images  are  left-justified  within  the width of the
       tiled area.  The order of the images is the same  as  they
       appear  on the command line unless the images have a scene
       keyword. If a scene number is  specified  in  each  image,
       then  the images are tiled onto the composite in the order
       of their scene number. Finally, the last argument  on  the
       command  line is the name assigned to the composite image.
       By default, the image is written in the  MIFF  format  and
       can be viewed or printed with display.

       Note, that if the number of tiles exceeds the default num­
       ber of 20 (5 per row, 4 per column), more than one compos­
       ite  image  is  created.  To ensure a single image is pro­
       duced, use -tile to increase the number of tiles  to  meet
       or exceed the number of input images.

       Finally,  to  create  one  or  more  empty  spaces  in the
       sequence of tiles, use the NULL image format.

EXAMPLES
       To create a montage of a cockatoo, a parrot,  and  a  hum­
       mingbird and write it to a file called birds, use:

           montage cockatoo.miff parrot.miff hummingbird.miff \
                   birds.miff

       To  tile  several bird images so that they are at most 256
       pixels in width and 192 pixels in height, surrounded by  a
       red  border,  and  separated  by  10  pixels of background
       color, use:

           montage -geometry 256x192"+1"0"+1"0 -bordercolor \
                   red birds.* montage.miff

       To create an unlabeled parrot image, 640  by  480  pixels,
       and surrounded by a border of black, use:

           montage -geometry 640x480 -bordercolor black \
                   -label "" parrot.miff bird.miff

       To create an image of an eagle with a textured background,
       use:

           montage -texture bumps.jpg eagle.jpg eagle.png

       To join several GIF images together without any extraneous
       graphics  (e.g.   no  label,  no shadowing, no surrounding
       tile frame), use:

           montage +frame +shadow +label -tile 5x1 \
                   -geometry 50x50+0+0 *.png joined.png

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line  order.  Any  option
       you specify on the command line remains in effect until it
       is explicitly changed by specifying the option again  with
       a  different  effect.  For example, to montage two images,
       the first with 32 colors and the second with only 16  col­
       ors, use:

            montage -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -colors 16 cockatoo.2 \
                    cockatoo.miff

       -adjoin
              join images into a single multi-image file

              By default, all images of  an  image  sequence  are
              stored  in  the  same  file.  However, some formats
              (e.g. JPEG) do not support more than one image  and
              are  saved  to separate files. Use +adjoin to force
              this behavior.


       -background color
              the background color

       -blur <radius>x<sigma>
              blur the image with a gaussian operator

              Blur with the given radius and  standard  deviation
              (sigma).


       -bordercolor color
              the border color

       -borderwidth color
              the border width

       -cache threshold
              megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

              Image   pixels   are  stored  in  memory  until  80
              megabytes of memory have been consumed.  Subsequent
              pixel  operations are cached on disk. Operations to
              memory are significantly faster but  if  your  com­
              puter  does  not  have  a sufficient amount of free
              memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.


       -chop <width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}
              remove pixels from the interior of an image

              The width and height give the number of columns and
              rows to remove, and the offsets give  the  location
              of the leftmost column and topmost row to remove.


              The  -chop  option removes entire rows and columns,
              and moves the remaining corner blocks leftward  and
              upward to close the gaps.


       -colors value
              preferred number of colors in the image

              The  actual  number  of  colors in the image may be
              less than your request, but never more. Note,  this
              is  a  color  reduction  option.  Images  with less
              unique colors than specified with this option  will
              have  any duplicate or unused colors removed. Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and  -treedepth
              affect the color reduction algorithm.


       -colorspace value
              the type of colorspace

              Choices  are:  GRAY,  OHTA,  RGB, Transparent, XYZ,
              YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, YUV, or CMYK.


              Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB
              color  space. Empirical evidence suggests that dis­
              tances in color spaces such as YUV  or  YIQ  corre­
              spond  to perceptual color differences more closely
              than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces
              may  give  better  results  when  color reducing an
              image.  Refer to quantize for more details.


              The Transparent color  space  behaves  uniquely  in
              that it preserves the matte channel of the image if
              it exists.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -comment string
              annotate an image with a comment

              Use this option to assign a specific comment to the
              image. You can include the  image  filename,  type,
              width,  height,  or other image attribute by embed­
              ding special format characters:


                   %b   file size
                   %c   comment
                   %d   directory
                   %e   filename extention
                   %f   filename
                   %h   height
                   %i   input filename
                   %k   number of unique colors
                   %l   label
                   %m   magick
                   %n   number of scenes
                   %o   output filename
                   %p   page number
                   %q   quantum depth
                   %s   scene number
                   %t   top of filename
                   %u   unique temporary filename
                   %w   width
                   %x   x resolution
                   %y   y resolution
                   \n   newline
                   \r   carriage return

              For example,


                   -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image comment of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480
              for  an  image  titled bird.miff and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.


              If the first character of string is  @,  the  image
              comment is read from a file titled by the remaining
              characters in the string.


       -compose operator
              the type of image composition

              By default, each of the composite image pixels  are
              replaced by the corresponding image tile pixel. You
              can choose an alternate composite operation:


                   Over
                   In
                   Out
                   Atop
                   Xor
                   Plus
                   Minus
                   Add
                   Subtract
                   Difference
                   Multiply
                   Bumpmap
                   Copy
                   CopyRed
                   CopyGreen
                   CopyBlue
                   CopyOpacity

              How each operator behaves is described below.


               Over


                    The result will be the union of the two image
                    shapes,  with opaque areas of composite image
                    obscuring image in the region of overlap.

               In


                    The result is simply composite image  cut  by
                    the  shape  of image.  None of the image data
                    of image will be in the result.

               Out


                    The resulting image is composite  image  with
                    the shape of image cut out.

               Atop


                    The  result is the same shape as image image,
                    with composite image  obscuring  image  where
                    the  image shapes overlap.  Note this differs
                    from over because the  portion  of  composite
                    image  outside  image's shape does not appear
                    in the result.

               Xor


                    The result is the image data from  both  com­
                    posite  image  and  image that is outside the
                    overlap region.  The overlap region  will  be
                    blank.

               Plus


                    The result is just the sum of the image data.
                    Output values are cropped to  255  (no  over­
                    flow).   This operation is independent of the
                    matte channels.

               Minus


                    The result of composite image -  image,  with
                    underflow cropped to zero.  The matte channel
                    is ignored (set to 255, full coverage).

               Add


                    The result of composite image +  image,  with
                    overflow wrapping around (mod 256).

               Subtract


                    The  result  of composite image - image, with
                    underflow wrapping around (mod 256).  The add
                    and subtract operators can be used to perform
                    reversible transformations.

               Difference


                    The result of abs(composite image  -  image).
                    This is useful for comparing two very similar
                    images.

               Multiply


                    The result of composite image * image.   This
                    is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

               Bumpmap


                    The result image shaded by composite image.

               Copy


                    The  resulting  image  is image replaced with
                    composite image.  Here the matte  information
                    is ignored.

               CopyRed


                    The resulting image is the red layer in image
                    replaced with  the  red  layer  in  composite
                    image.    The   other   layers   are   copied
                    untouched.

               CopyGreen


                    The resulting image is  the  green  layer  in
                    image  replaced  with the green layer in com­
                    posite image.  The other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.

               CopyBlue


                    The  resulting  image  is  the  blue layer in
                    image replaced with the blue layer in compos­
                    ite  image.   The  other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.

               CopyOpacity


                    The resulting image is  the  matte  layer  in
                    image  replaced  with the matte layer in com­
                    posite image.  The other  layers  are  copied
                    untouched.



               The  image  compositor  requires a matte, or alpha
               channel in the image for  some  operations.   This
               extra  channel usually defines a mask which repre­
               sents a sort of a  cookie-cutter  for  the  image.
               This is the case when matte is 255 (full coverage)
               for pixels inside the  shape,  zero  outside,  and
               between zero and 255 on the boundary.  For certain
               operations, if image does not have a  matte  chan­
               nel, it is initialized with 0 for any pixel match­
               ing in color to pixel  location  (0,0),  otherwise
               255 (to work properly borderwidth must be 0).


       -compress type
              the type of image compression

              Choices  are:  None,  BZip, Fax, Group4, JPEG, LZW,
              RLE or Zip.


              Specify +compress to store the binary image  in  an
              uncompressed  format.   The default is the compres­
              sion type of the specified image file.


       -crop <width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}
              preferred size and location of the cropped image

              See X(1) for details about the geometry  specifica­
              tion.


              The  width  and  height  give the size of the image
              that remains after cropping, and the  offsets  give
              the  location of the top left corner of the cropped
              image with respect to the original image.  To spec­
              ify the amount to be removed, use -shave instead.


              To  specify  a  percentage  width  or  height to be
              removed instead, append %. For example to crop  the
              image  by ten percent (five percent on each side of
              the image), use -crop 10%.


              Use cropping to apply image processing options  to,
              or display, a particular area of an image.


              Omit  the  x  and  y offset to generate one or more
              subimages of a uniform size.


              Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.
              Use -crop 0x0 to trim edges that are the background
              color. Add an x and y offset to leave a portion  of
              the trimmed edges with the image.


       -debug enable debug printout

       -density <width>x<height>
              vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the
              image

              This option specifies an image density when  decod­
              ing  a  PostScript  or  Portable Document page. The
              default is 72 dots per inch in the  horizontal  and
              vertical  direction. This option is used in concert
              with -page.


       -depth value
              depth of the image

              This is the number of bits in  a  pixel.  The  only
              acceptable  values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to
              specify the depth of  raw  images  whose  depth  is
              unknown  such  as  GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change
              the depth of any image after it has been read.


       -display host:display[.screen]

       -dispose method
              GIF disposal method

              Here are the valid methods:


                   0     No disposal specified.
                   1     Do not dispose between frames.
                   2     Overwrite frame  with  background  color
              from header.
                   3     Overwrite with previous frame.

       -dither
              apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

              The  basic strategy of dithering is to trade inten­
              sity resolution for spatial resolution by averaging
              the  intensities  of  several  neighboring  pixels.
              Images which suffer  from  severe  contouring  when
              reducing colors can be improved with this option.


              The  -colors  or -monochrome option is required for
              this option to take effect.


              Use +dither to render Postscript  without  text  or
              graphic aliasing.


       -draw string
              annotate  an  image with one or more graphic primi­
              tives

              Use this option to annotate an image  with  one  or
              more graphic primitives.  The primitives include


                   point
                   line
                   rectangle
                   roundRectangle
                   arc
                   ellipse
                   circle
                   polyline
                   polygon
                   bezier
                   path
                   color
                   matte
                   text
                   image

              Point  and  line  each require a single coordinate.
              Line requires a start  and  end  coordinate,  while
              rectangle  expects  an  upper  left and lower right
              coordinate.  roundRectangle has  a  center  coordi­
              nate,  a width and height, and the width and height
              of the corners.  Circle has a center coordinate and
              a  coordinate  for the outer edge.  Use Arc to cir­
              cumscribe an arc within a rectangle.  Arcs  require
              a  start  and  end  point  as well as the degree of
              rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90).  Use  Ellipse
              to  draw  a  partial  ellipse centered at the given
              point with the x-axis and y-axis radius  and  start
              and  end  of  arc  in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150
              0,360).   Finally,  polyline  and  polygon  require
              three or more coordinates to define its boundaries.
              Coordinates are integers separated by  an  optional
              comma.  For example, to define a circle centered at
              100,100 that extends to 150,150 use:


                   -draw 'circle 100,100 150,150'

              See Paths.  Paths represent an outline of an object
              which is defined in terms of moveto (set a new cur­
              rent point), lineto (draw a straight line), curveto
              (draw  a curve using a cubic bezier), arc (ellipti­
              cal or circular arc) and closepath (close the  cur­
              rent  shape  by  drawing a line to the last moveto)
              elements. Compound paths (i.e., a  path  with  sub­
              paths,  each consisting of a single moveto followed
              by one or more line or curve operations) are possi­
              ble  to  allow  effects  such  as  "donut holes" in
              objects.


              Use color to change the color of  a  pixel.  Follow
              the pixel coordinate with a method:


                   point
                   replace
                   floodfill
                   filltoborder
                   reset

              Consider the target pixel as that specified by your
              coordinate. The point method  recolors  the  target
              pixel.  The  replace method recolors any pixel that
              matches the color of the target  pixel.   Floodfill
              recolors  any  pixel  that matches the color of the
              target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas  filltobor­
              der  recolors  any  neighbor  pixel that is not the
              border color. Finally, reset recolors all pixels.


              Use matte to the change the pixel  matte  value  to
              transparent.  Follow  the  pixel  coordinate with a
              method (see the color primitive for  a  description
              of  methods).  The  point  method changes the matte
              value of  the  target  pixel.  The  replace  method
              changes  the  matte value of any pixel that matches
              the color of the target  pixel.  Floodfill  changes
              the matte value of any pixel that matches the color
              of the target pixel  and  is  a  neighbor,  whereas
              filltoborder  changes the matte value of any neigh­
              bor pixel that is not the  border  color  (-border­
              color).   Finally  reset changes the matte value of
              all pixels.


              Use text to annotate an image with text. Follow the
              text  coordinates  with a string. If the string has
              embedded  spaces,  enclose  it  in  double  quotes.
              Optionally  you  can  include  the  image filename,
              type, width, height, or other  image  attribute  by
              embedding  special  format character.  See -comment
              for details.


              For example,


                   -draw 'text 100,100 "%m:%f %wx%h"'

              annotates the image with MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for
              an  image  titled  bird.miff and whose width is 512
              and height is 480.


              Use image to composite an image with another image.
              Follow  the image keyword with the composite opera­
              tor, image location, image size, and filename:


                   -draw 'image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg'

              See -compose for a  description  of  the  composite
              operators.


              If  the first character of string is @, the text is
              read from a file titled by the remaining characters
              in the string.


              You  can  set  the primitive color, font color, and
              font bounding box color with -fill, -font, and -box
              respectively. Options are processed in command line
              order so be sure to  use  -fill  before  the  -draw
              option.


       -fill color
              color to use when filling a graphic primitive

              See -draw for further details.


       -filter type
              use this type of filter when resizing an image

              Use this option to affect the resizing operation of
              an image (see -geometry).  Choose from  these  fil­
              ters:


                   Point
                   Box
                   Triangle
                   Hermite
                   Hanning
                   Hamming
                   Blackman
                   Gaussian
                   Quadratic
                   Cubic
                   Catrom
                   Mitchell
                   Lanczos
                   Bessel
                   Sinc

              The default filter is Lanczos


       -font name
              use this font when annotating the image with text

              You  can  tag  a  font  to  specify whether it is a
              Postscript, Truetype, or OPTION1 font.   For  exam­
              ple,  Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica is
              Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1.


       -frame <width>x<height>+<outer bevel  width>+<inner  bevel
              width>"  surround the image with an ornamental bor­
              der

              See X(1) for details about the geometry  specifica­
              tion.


              The color of the border is specified with the -mat­
              tecolor command line option.


       -gamma value
              level of gamma correction

              The same color image  displayed  on  two  different
              workstations  may look different due to differences
              in the display monitor.  Use  gamma  correction  to
              adjust for this color difference. Reasonable values
              extend from 0.8 to 2.3.


              You can apply separate gamma  values  to  the  red,
              green,  and blue channels of the image with a gamma
              value   list   delineated   with   slashes    (i.e.
              1.7/2.3/1.2).


              Use +gamma value to set the image gamma level with­
              out  actually  adjusting  the  image  pixels.  This
              option  is  useful if the image is of a known gamma
              but  not  set  as  an  image  attribute  (e.g.  PNG
              images).


       -geometry    <width>x<height>{+-}<x   offset>{+-}<y   off­
       set>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
              preferred size and location of the Image window.

              See  X(1) for details about the geometry specifica­
              tion. By default, the window size is the image size
              and  the  location  is  chosen  by  you  when it is
              mapped.


              By default, the width and height are  maximum  val­
              ues.  That  is, the image is expanded or contracted
              to fit the width and height value while maintaining
              the  aspect  ratio of the image. Append an exclama­
              tion point to the geometry to force the image  size
              to  exactly  the  size you specify. For example, if
              you specify 640x480! the image width is set to  640
              pixels  and  height  to  480. If only one factor is
              specified, both the width  and  height  assume  the
              value.


              To  specify  a  percentage width or height instead,
              append %. The image size is multiplied by the width
              and  height  percentages  to obtain the final image
              dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a
              value  greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an
              image's size, use a percentage less than 100.


              Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels  of  an
              image.


              Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification.  <
              resizes  the  image  only if its dimensions is less
              than the geometry specification.  For  example,  if
              you  specify  '640x480>'  and  the  image  size  is
              512x512, the image size does not  change.  However,
              if  the  image  is  1024x1024,  it  is  resized  to
              640x480.


              Use < to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its  size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification. >
              resizes the image only if its  dimensions  is  less
              than  the  geometry  specification. For example, if
              you specify 640x480> and the image size is 512x512,
              the  image  size  does  not change. However, if the
              image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.


              There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript  coordi­
              nates.


       -gravity type
              direction  text  gravitates  to when annotating the
              image.

              Choices are:  NorthWest,  North,  NorthEast,  West,
              Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast. See X(1)
              for details about the gravity specification.


              The direction you choose specifies where  to  posi­
              tion  the text when annotating the image. For exam­
              ple Center gravity forces the text to  be  centered
              within  the image. By default, the image gravity is
              NorthWest.


       -help  print usage instructions

       -interlace type
              the type of interlacing scheme

              Choices are: None, Line, Plane, or  Partition.  The
              default is None.


              This  option  is used to specify the type of inter­
              lacing scheme for raw image formats such as RGB  or
              YUV.  None  means do not interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRG­
              BRGB...),   Line    uses    scanline    interlacing
              (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),  and  Plane
              uses               plane                interlacing
              (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).   Partition  is like
              plane except the  different  planes  are  saved  to
              individual   files   (e.g.  image.R,  image.G,  and
              image.B).


              Use Line, or Plane to create an interlaced  PNG  or
              GIF or progressive JPEG image.


       -label name
              assign a label to an image

              Use  this  option to assign a specific label to the
              image. Optionally you can include the  image  file­
              name, type, width, height, or other image attribute
              by embedding special format character. See -comment
              for details.


              For example,


                   -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces  an  image label of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480
              for an image titled bird.miff and  whose  width  is
              512 and height is 480.


              If  the  first  character of string is @, the image
              label is read from a file titled by  the  remaining
              characters in the string.


              When  converting  to PostScript, use this option to
              specify a header string to print above  the  image.
              Specify the label font with -font.


       -matte store matte channel if the image has one

              If  the image does not have a matte channel, create
              an opaque one.


       -mattecolor color
              specify the matte color

       -mode value
              mode of operation

       -monochrome
              transform the image to black and white

       -page    <width>x<height>{+-}<x     offset>{+-}<y     off­
       set>{%}{!}{<}{>}
              size and location of an image canvas

              Use this option to specify the  dimensions  of  the
              PostScript  page in dots per inch or a TEXT page in
              pixels. The choices for a Postscript page are:

              For convenience you can specify the  page  size  by
              media  (e.g.  A4,  Ledger,  etc.). Otherwise, -page
              behaves  much  like  -geometry  (e.g.   -page  let­
              ter+43+43>).


              To  position  a  GIF  image,  use  -page{+-}<x off­
              set>{+-}<y offset> (e.g. -page +100+200).


              For a Postscript page, the image  is  sized  as  in
              -geometry and positioned relative to the lower left
              hand corner of the page by {+-}<xoffset>{+-}<y off­
              set>.  Use  -page  612x792>, for example, to center
              the image  within  the  page.  If  the  image  size
              exceeds  the  Postscript page, it is reduced to fit
              the page.


              The default page dimensions for  a  TEXT  image  is
              612x792.


              This option is used in concert with -density.


       -pen color
              specify the pen color for drawing operations

       -pointsize value
              pointsize  of  the Postscript, OPTION1, or TrueType
              font

       -quality value
              JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level

              For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst)  to
              100 (best). The default quality is 75.


              Quality  for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the
              amount of image compression (quality / 10) and fil­
              ter-type (quality % 10). Compression quality values
              range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). If  filter-type
              is 4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for
              all scanlines:


                   0: none
                   1: sub
                   2: up
                   3: average
                   4: Paeth

              If filter-type is 5,  adaptive  filtering  is  used
              when  quality is greater than 50 and the image does
              not have a color map,  otherwise  no  filtering  is
              used.


              If  filter-type  is  6  or more, adaptive filtering
              with minimum-sum-of-absolute-values is used.


              The default is quality is 75.  Which  means  nearly
              the best compression with adaptive filtering.


              For further information, see the PNG specification.


       -rotate degrees{<}{>}
              apply Paeth image rotation to the image

              Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds
              the  height.  < rotates the image only if its width
              is less than the height. For example, if you  spec­
              ify  -90>  and the image size is 480x640, the image
              is not rotated by the specified angle. However,  if
              the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.


              Empty triangles left over from rotating  the  image
              are  filled  with  the  color defined as background
              (class backgroundColor). See X(1) for details.


       -scene value{-value}
              image scene number or range

              Use this option to specify an image sequence with a
              single  filename.  See the discussion of file below
              for details.

       -shadow <radius>x<sigma>
              shadow the montage

       -sharpen <radius>x<sigma>
              sharpen the image

              Use a gaussian operator of  the  given  radius  and
              standard deviation (sigma).


       -size <width>x<height>{+offset}
              width and height of the image

              Use  this option to specify the width and height of
              raw images whose dimensions  are  unknown  such  as
              GRAY,  RGB,  or  CMYK.  In  addition  to  width and
              height, use -size with an offset to skip any header
              information in the image or tell the number of col­
              ors in a MAP image file, (e.g. -size  640x512+256).


              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally,  use  this  option  to choose a particular
              resolution layer of a  JBIG  or  JPEG  image  (e.g.
              -size 1024x768).


       -stroke color
              color to use when stroking a graphic primitive

              See -draw for further details.


       -strokewidth value
              set the stroke width

              See -draw for further details.


       -texture filename
              name of texture to tile onto the image background

       -tile geometry
              layout of images

       -title assign a title to the displayed image

              Use  this  option to assign a specific title to the
              image. This is assigned to the image window and  is
              typically   displayed  in  the  window  title  bar.
              Optionally you  can  include  the  image  filename,
              type,  width,  height,  or other image attribute by
              embedding special format characters:

                   %b file size
                   %c comment
                   %d directory
                   %e filename extention
                   %f filename
                   %h height
                   %i input filename
                   %k number of unique colors
                   %l label
                   %m magick
                   %n number of scenes
                   %o output filename
                   %p page number
                   %q quantum depth
                   %s scene number
                   %t top of filename
                   %u unique temporary filename
                   %w width
                   %x x resolution
                   %y y resolution
                   \n newline
                   \r carriage return

              For example,


                   -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image title of  MIFF:bird.miff  512x480
              for  an  image  titled bird.miff and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.


       -transparent color
              make this color transparent within the image

       -treedepth value
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero
              or  one  tells  display  to  choose an optimal tree
              depth for the color reduction algorithm

              An optimal depth generally allows the  best  repre­
              sentation of the source image with the fastest com­
              putational speed and the least  amount  of  memory.
              However,  the  default  depth  is inappropriate for
              some images. To assure the best representation, try
              values  between  2 and 8 for this parameter.  Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -type type
              the image type

              Choose from: Bilevel, Grayscale, Palette, PaletteM­
              atte, TrueColor,  TrueColorMatte,  ColorSeparation,
              ColorSeparationMatte, or Optimize.


       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is  printed: image scene number;
              image name; image size; the  image  class  (Direct­
              Class  or  PseudoClass); the total number of unique
              colors; and the  number  of  seconds  to  read  and
              transform  the image.  Refer to miff for a descrip­
              tion of the image class.


              If -colors is also specified, the total unique col­
              ors  in  the image and color reduction error values
              are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of
              these values.


FILES AND FORMATS
       By  default,  the  image format is determined by its magic
       number. To specify a particular image format, precede  the
       filename  with  an  image  format  name  and a colon (i.e.
       ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
       (e.g.  image.ps). See convert(1) for a list of valid image
       formats.

       When you specify X as your image type,  the  filename  has
       special  meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or
       root. If no filename is specified, the window is  selected
       by clicking the mouse in the desired window.

       Specify file as - for standard input, output_file as - for
       standard output. If file has the extension .Z or the  file
       is  uncompressed  with  uncompress or gunzip respectively.
       If output_file has the extension compress or gzip  respec­
       tively.  Finally,  precede  the  image file name with | to
       pipe to or from a system command.

       Use an optional index enclosed in brackets  after  a  file
       name  to  specify a desired subimage of a multi-resolution
       image format like Photo CD  (e.g.   img0001.pcd[4])  or  a
       range  for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]). A subimage
       specification can be  disjoint  (e.g.  image.tiff[2,7,4]).
       For  raw  images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g.
       -size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

       Single images are written with the filename  you  specify.
       However,  multi-part  images (i.e. a multi-page PostScript
       document with +adjoin  specified)  are  written  with  the
       filename  followed  by  a period (.) and the scene number.
       You can change this behavior by embedding a printf  format
       specification  in  the  file  name.  For example, montages
       files image00.miff, image01.miff, etc.

       Prepend an at sign @ to a filename to read a list of image
       filenames  from that file. This is convenient in the event
       you have too many image filenames to fit  on  the  command
       line.

       Note, a composite MIFF image displayed to an X server with
       display behaves differently than  other  images.  You  can
       think of the composite as a visual image directory. Choose
       a particular tile of the composite and press a  button  to
       display it. See display(1) and miff(5)

X RESOURCES
       Montage  options can appear on the command line or in your
       X resource file. Options on  the  command  line  supersede
       values  specified  in  your  X resource file. See X(1) for
       more information on X resources.

       All montage options have a corresponding  X  resource.  In
       addition, montage uses the following X resources:

       background (class Background)
              background color

              Specifies  the  preferred color to use for the com­
              posite image background.  The default is #ccc.

       borderColor (class BorderColor)
              border color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for  the  com­
              posite image border. The default is #ccc.

       borderWidth (class BorderWidth)
              border width

              Specifies  the  width  in  pixels  of the composite
              image border. The default is 2.

       font (class Font)
              font to use

              Specifies the name of the  preferred  font  to  use
              when  displaying  text  within the composite image.
              The default is 9x15, fixed, or  5x8  determined  by
              the composite image size.

       matteColor (class MatteColor)
              color of the frame

              Specify the color of an image frame. A 3D effect is
              achieved  by  using  highlight  and  shadow  colors
              derived  from  this  color.  The  default  value is
              #697B8F.

       pen (class Pen)
              text color

              Specifies the  preferred  color  to  use  for  text
              within  the composite image.  The default is black.

       title (class Title)
              composite image title

              This resource specifies the title to be  placed  at
              the  top of the composite image. The default is not
              to place a title at the top of the composite image.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
              To  get  the  default  host,  display  number,  and
              screen.
