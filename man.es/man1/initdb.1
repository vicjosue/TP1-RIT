NAME
       initdb - create a new PostgreSQL database cluster

SYNOPSIS
       initdb   --pgdata  | -D directory [ --username  | -U user­
       name ] [ --pwprompt | -W ] [ --encoding  | -E encoding ] [
       -L directory ] [ --noclean | -n ] [ --debug | -d ]

DESCRIPTION
       initdb  creates  a  new  PostgreSQL  database  cluster (or
       database system). A database cluster is  a  collection  of
       databases that are managed by a single server instance.

       Creating a database system consists of creating the direc­
       tories in which the database data  will  live,  generating
       the shared catalog tables (tables that belong to the whole
       cluster rather than to any particular database), and  cre­
       ating  the  template1  database.  When  you  create  a new
       database, everything in the template1 database is  copied.
       It  contains  catalog tables filled in for things like the
       built-in types.

       initdb must be run as the user that will  own  the  server
       process,  because  the  server needs to have access to the
       files and directories  that  initdb  creates.   Since  the
       server  may not be run as root, you must not run initdb as
       root either. (It will in fact refuse to do so.)

       Although initdb will attempt to create the specified  data
       directory,  often it won't have permission to do so, since
       the parent of the desired data directory is often a  root-
       owned  directory. To set up an arrangement like this, cre­
       ate an empty data directory as root,  then  use  chown  to
       hand over ownership of that directory to the database user
       account, then su to become the database user, and  finally
       run initdb as the database user.

   OPTIONS
       --pgdata=directory

       -D directory
              This  option  specifies  the  directory  where  the
              database system should be stored. This is the  only
              information  required  by initdb, but you can avoid
              writing it by setting the PGDATA environment  vari­
              able,  which  can  be convenient since the database
              server (postmaster) can find the database directory
              later by the same variable.

       --username=username

       -U username
              Selects  the  user  name of the database superuser.
              This defaults to the name  of  the  effective  user
              running initdb. It is really not important what the
              superuser's name is, but one might choose  to  keep
              the  customary name ``postgres'', even if the oper­
              ating system user's name is different.

       --pwprompt

       -W     Makes initdb prompt for  a  password  to  give  the
              database  superuser.  If  you  don't  plan on using
              password authentication,  this  is  not  important.
              Otherwise you won't be able to use password authen­
              tication until you have a password set up.

       --encoding=encoding

       -E encoding
              Selects the encoding of the template database. This
              will  also  be the default encoding of any database
              you create later, unless you override it there.  To
              use  the encoding feature, you must have enabled it
              at build time, at which time you  also  select  the
              default for this option.


       Other, less commonly used, parameters are also available:

       -L directory
              Specifies  where initdb should find its input files
              to initialize the database system. This is normally
              not  necessary.  You  will  be  told if you need to
              specify their location explicitly.

       --noclean

       -n     By default, when initdb determines  that  an  error
              prevented  it from completely creating the database
              system, it removes any files it  may  have  created
              before  discovering  that  it can't finish the job.
              This option inhibits tidying-up and is thus  useful
              for debugging.

       --debug

       -d     Print  debugging  output from the bootstrap backend
              and a few other messages of lesser interest for the
              general  public.  The bootstrap backend is the pro­
              gram initdb uses to create the catalog tables. This
              option  generates  a tremendous amount of extremely
              boring output.


ENVIRONMENT
       PGDATA Specifies the directory where the  database  system
              is  to  be  stored;  may be overridden using the -D
              option.
