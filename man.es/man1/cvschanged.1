       cvschanged -- Lists all files in checked out CVS modules

       When the current directory is a CVS module:

               cvschanged

       Checking checked out subdirectories:

               cvschanged [<dir>...]


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       cvschanged will list all files in each checked-out module
       (and subdirectories) that have been edited or merged. This
       is done without needing to contact the CVS server, which
       greatly increases the speed for people who have a slow
       connection.
