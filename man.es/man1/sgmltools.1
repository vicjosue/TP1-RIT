NAME
       sgmltools  -  SGML-tools  translators to other markup lan­
       guages

SYNOPSIS
       sgml2xxx     [generic-option...]      [backend-options...]
       file[.sgml]

DESCRIPTION
       The  sgmltools  suite  is  a collection of text formatters
       which understands a small family of  SGML-based  document-
       structure markup languages. Each formatter (or "back-end")
       renders the common markup languages into a variety of out­
       put  formats,  including HTML, TeX, DVI, PostScript, plain
       text, and groff(1)  source  in  manual-page  format.   The
       SGML-tools  suite  is useful for authoring documents which
       must be distributed in  a  variety  of  formats  including
       plain text, hypertext, and high-quality typeset books.

       The  markup  language(s)  accepted  by these formatters is
       described in the SGML-Tools User's Guide.  They are  vari­
       ants  of  an  SGML  document  type  definition  originally
       designed by Matt Welsh for Linux documentation.

OPTIONS
       Most command-line options are accepted by  all  back-ends.
       Some back-ends have additional specific options to control
       rendering to their particular output format.  Here are the
       common options:

       --papersize=size, -p
              Set  the  paper  size.  Default is ``letter''.  You
              may also specify ``a4''  size  (European  297x210mm
              paper).

       --language=lang, -l
              Specify  the  language  of  the  document (this may
              change which style files are used for formatting by
              a  back end).  The default language is English. Run
              an SGML-tools command without arguments to see  the
              list of valid language codes.

       --charset=chars, -c
              Specify the output character encoding.  Defaults to
              ``ascii'' selecting the ASCII set; you may  specify
              "latin" to specify the ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) charac­
              ter set.

       --style=file, -S
              Include an auxiliary DTD (Document Type Definition)
              from $LINUXDOCLIB/dtd.

       --tabsize=n, -t
              Set the tab spacing assumed for generating the out­
              put document.  The default tab spacing is 8.

       --debug, -d
              Don't delete intermediate files (such as .TeX files
              generated  on  the  way  to  a  .dvi, or .man files
              deleted on the way to plain text).

       --define, -D
              Pass attribute/value pairs to  be  matched  against
              "if"  and  "unless"  conditionals.   See the User's
              Guide for extended discussion of this feature.

       --include, -i
              Pass a -i option to nsgmls(1).  This  may  be  used
              for  conditional inclusion.  See the nsgmls(1) man­
              ual page for details.

       --pass, -P
              Pass an option string to the back end.   The  exact
              semantics  of this option are dependent on the back
              end and should be explained in the individual  man­
              ual pages for each.

       file   The   SGML   source  file,  named  either  file  or
              file.sgml.

       Running a back-end with no arguments will cause it to list
       all its options.  The available back ends include:

       sgml2html
              translate to HTML

       sgml2info
              translate to GNU info

       sgml2lyx
              translate to Lyx macros

       sgml2latex
              translate to LaTeX 2e

       sgml2rtf
              translate to Microsoft Rich Text Format

       sgml2txt
              translate to plain text or Unix manual-page markup.

       There is also a tool sgmlcheck(1) available  for  checking
       the SGML-Tools syntax of document sources without actually
       generating a translated version.

FILES
       Many files and executables  in  $LINUXDOCLIB  and  $LINUX­
       DOCBIN are used.

BUGS
       None known.
