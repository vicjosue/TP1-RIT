       droplang - remove a PostgreSQL procedural language

SYNOPSIS
       droplang [ connection-options... ] langname [ dbname ]

   INPUTS
       droplang accepts the following command line arguments:

       langname
              Specifies  the name of the backend programming lan­
              guage to be removed.

       [-d, --dbname] dbname
              Specifies from which database the  language  should
              be  removed.   The  default  is to use the database
              with the same name as the current system user.

       -e, --echo
              Displays SQL commands as they are executed.

       -l, --list
              Shows a list of already installed languages in  the
              target database (which must be specified).


       droplang also accepts the following command line arguments
       for connection parameters:

       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server  is running. If host begins with a slash, it
              is used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix  domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies  the  Internet  TCP/IP port or local Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -U, --username username
              User name to connect as

       -W, --password
              Force password prompt.


   OUTPUTS
       Most  error  messages  are  self-explanatory.  If not, run
       droplang with the --echo option and see under the  respec­
       tive SQL command for details. Check also under psql(1) for
       more possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       droplang is a utility for removing an existing programming
       language  from  a  PostgreSQL database.  droplang can drop
       any procedural language, even those not  supplied  by  the
       PostgreSQL distribution.

       Although  backend  programming  languages  can  be removed
       directly using several SQL commands, it is recommended  to
       use droplang because it performs a number of checks and is
       much easier to use. See DROP  LANGUAGE  [drop_language(7)]
       for more.

NOTES
       Use createlang(1) to add a language.

USAGE
       To remove pltcl:

       $ droplang pltcl dbname
