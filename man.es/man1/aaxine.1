NAME
       aaxine - an ASCII art video player


SYNOPSIS
       aaxine  [aalib-options] [-A<audio-driver>] [-a<audio-chan­
       nel>] [-R<rec-by>] [MRL...]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains the aaxine program.  Aaxine,  is
       an   aalib   based   frontend  for  libxine,  a  versatile
       video/multimedia player.

       aaxine is for those who don't have a high end video  card,
       but just want to watch DVDs on their good old vt100 ;-)

       Like  xine,  aaxine  plays  MPEG  system (audio and video)
       streams,  mpeg  elementary  streams  (e.g.  .mp3  or  .mpv
       files),  avi files (using win32 codecs or ffmpeg), (S)VCDs
       and DVDs. In short, anything that's supported by xine-lib.


OPTIONS
       The  program  follows  usual GNU command line syntax, with
       long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of
       options  are  included below.  For a complete description,
       see README and FAQ in  /usr/share/doc/xine-ui  or  on  the
       xine home page.

       -h, --help
              Show   summary  of  options  and  available  output
              drivers (plugins).  A big bunch of these options is
              provided by aalib. Please refer to your aalib docu­
              mentation for those!

              The remaining  options,  labelled  AAXINE  options:
              when  listed  with  "aaxine  --help", are explained
              here.

       -A, --audio-driver <id>
              Use given audio driver. Available  drivers  can  be
              listed with "aaxine --help"

       -a, --audio-channel #
              Use  given audio channel. Channels are sequentially
              numbered from 0 for first audio track.

       -R, --recognize-by [option]
              Determine the method used to recognize stream type.
              Possible options are:
              default: by content, then by extension,
              revert: by extension, then by content,
              content: only by content,
              extension: only by extension.
              If  -R  is  given  without  an  additional option,,
              'revert' is selected.


MRLs
       MRLs are  similar  to  URLs  in  your  web  browser.  They
       describe  the  media to read from. valid MRLs may be plain
       file names or one of the following:
       file://<path>
       fifo://<path>
       stdin://mpeg1 or stdin://mpeg2
       dvd://VTS_xx_y.VOB
       vcd://<track number>
       tcp://<host>:<port>
       rtp://<host>:<port>
       udp://<host>:<port>

       Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of
       consecutive streams. Additional input plugins will provide
       additional MRL types.  The ones listed above are available
       with stock libxine...


CONTROL KEYS
       Many  features can be controlled by pressing control keys.
       The Key bindings are:

       RETURN or R: Play
       SPACE or P: Pause
       0: Jump to start of current stream
       1..9: Jump to 10%..90% of current stream
       PgUp: Jump to previous stream in playlist
       PgDown: Jump to next stream in playlist
       +: Select next audio channel (may take up to a few seconds
       to take effect)
       -: Select prev audio channel
       Q: Exit.


BUGS
       none, of course ;-) Well, there are surely a few of those.
       You can probably best ask for support (and report bugs) on
       our mailing list at <xine-user@lists.sf.net>.
