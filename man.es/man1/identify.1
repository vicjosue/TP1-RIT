NAME
       display - display an image on an X terminal

SYNOPSIS
       identify file [ file ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       Identify  describes  the format and characteristics of one
       or more image files. It will also report if  an  image  is
       incomplete or corrupt.  The information displayed includes
       the scene number, the file name, the width and  height  of
       the  image,  whether  the image is colormapped or not, the
       number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in  the
       image,  the  format  of  the  image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and
       finally the number of seconds it took to read and  process
       the image. An example line output from identify follows:

           images/aquarium.miff  640x480 PseudoClass 256c 308135b
       MIFF 1s

       If -verbose is set, expect additional output including any
       image comment:


           Image: images/aquarium.miff
           class: PseudoClass
           colors: 256
           signature:
       eb5dca81dd93ae7e6ffae99a527eb5dca81dd93ae7e6ffae99a5275a53e
           matte: False
           geometry: 640x480
              depth: 8
           bytes: 308135
           format: MIFF
           comments:
           Imported from MTV raster image: aquarium.mtv

OPTIONS
       Options  are  processed  in command line order. Any option
       you specify on the command line remains in effect until it
       is  explicitly changed by specifying the option again with
       a different effect.

       -cache threshold
              megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

              Image  pixels  are  stored  in  memory   until   80
              megabytes  of memory have been consumed. Subsequent
              pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations  to
              memory  are  significantly  faster but if your com­
              puter does not have a  sufficient  amount  of  free
              memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.


       -debug enable debug printout

       -density <width>x<height>
              vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the
              image

              This   option   specifies  an  image  density  when
              decoding a PostScript or  Portable  Document  page.
              The  default  is 72 dots per inch in the horizontal
              and vertical direction. This option is used in con­
              cert with -page.


       -depth value
              depth of the image

              This  is  the  number  of bits in a pixel. The only
              acceptable values are 8 or 16.  Use this option  to
              specify  the  depth  of  raw  images whose depth is
              unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK,  or  to  change
              the depth of any image after it has been read.


       -format
              output formatted image characteristics

       -help  print usage instructions

       -ping  efficiently determine image characteristics

       -size <width>x<height>{+offset}
              width and height of the image

              Use  this option to specify the width and height of
              raw images whose dimensions  are  unknown  such  as
              GRAY,  RGB,  or  CMYK.  In  addition  to  width and
              height, use -size with an offset to skip any header
              information in the image or tell the number of col­
              ors in a MAP image file, (e.g. -size  640x512+256).


              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally,  use  this  option  to choose a particular
              resolution layer of a  JBIG  or  JPEG  image  (e.g.
              -size 1024x768).


       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is  printed: image scene number;
              image name; image size; the  image  class  (Direct­
              Class  or  PseudoClass); the total number of unique
              colors; and the  number  of  seconds  to  read  and
              transform  the image.  Refer to miff for a descrip­
              tion of the image class.


              If -colors is also specified, the total unique col­
              ors  in  the image and color reduction error values
              are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of
              these values.
