NAME
       open - start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT).

SYNOPSIS
       open  [-c  vtnumber] [-s] [-u] [-l] [-v] [--] command com­
       mand_options

DESCRIPTION
       open will find the first available VT, and run on  it  the
       given  command  with  the  given command options, standard
       input, output and error are directed to that terminal. The
       current  search path ($PATH) is used to find the requested
       command. If no command is specified then  the  environment
       variable $SHELL is used.

   OPTIONS
       -c vtnumber
              Use  the  given  VT number and not the first avail­
              able. Note you must have write access to  the  sup­
              plied VT for this to work.

       -s     Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The
              VT of the new command will be made the new  current
              VT.

       -u     Figure  out  the  owner  of the current VT, and run
              login as that user.  Suitable to be called by init.
              Shouldn't be used with -c or -l.

       -l     Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to
              the name of the command to be executed.

       -v     Be a bit more verbose.

       -w     wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used
              together then open will switch back to the control­
              ling terminal when the command completes.

       --     end of options to open.

NOTE
       If open is compiled with a POSIX (Gnu)  getopt()  and  you
       wish  to  set  options  to the command to be run, then you
       must supply the end of options -- flag before the command.


EXAMPLES
       open  can be used to start a shell on the next free VT, by
       using the command:

       open bash


       To start the shell as a login shell, use:

       open -l bash


       To get a long listing you must supply the -- separator:

       open -- ls -l
