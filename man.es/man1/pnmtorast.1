NAME
       pnmtorast  -  convert a portable pixmap into a Sun raster­
       file

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtorast [-standard|-rle] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Sun  raster­
       file as output.

       Color  values  in  Sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide, so
       pnmtorast will automatically scale colors to have a maxval
       of 255.  An extra pnmdepth step is not necessary.

OPTIONS
       The  -standard flag forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD
       form; the -rle flag,  RT_BYTE_ENCODED,  which  is  smaller
       but, well, less standard.  The default is -rle.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique pre­
       fix.
