NAME
       nautilus-xml-migrate  -  update  old  Nautilus  links  and
       metafiles

SYNOPSIS
       nautilus-xml-migrate [ directory ]

DESCRIPTION
       Old versions of nautilus(1) created XML files  (links  and
       metafiles)  with  incorrect  capitalization.  If your nau­
       tilus links now show up as plain-text files beginning with
       ``<?xml''  rather than as links, you can use nautilus-xml-
       migrate to correct them.

       When you  run  nautilus-xml-migrate  it  will  search  the
       directory  you  specify  (or  the current directory if you
       don't specify one) and all its  subdirectories  for  files
       named  .nautilus-metafile.xml and for files that begin the
       first line with ``<?xml'' and the second line with ``<NAU­
       TILUS''.  If any such files are found, it will correct all
       their XML tags to be lowercase instead of uppercase.

       As it proceeds it will display its best  guess  about  the
       percentage of the process that is complete.
