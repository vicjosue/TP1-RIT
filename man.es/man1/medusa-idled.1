NAME
       medusa-idled  -  keep medusa from indexing when the system
       is in use

SYNOPSIS
       medusa-idled

DESCRIPTION
       medusa-idled is normally run automatically at  login.   It
       puts  itself  in  the background, connects to the X server
       specified in  the  $DISPLAY  environmental  variable,  and
       begins   accepting   connections   on   the  local  socket
       /tmp/medusa-idled-service.

       Each client that connects to the socket  will  immediately
       receive  a  message telling it whether the X server is, at
       that moment, idle or not.  The message will be either ``No
       user activity\n'' or ``User activity\n''.  Later, when the
       X server goes from being idle to  being  active,  or  vice
       versa,  each  of  the connected clients will be sent a new
       message notifying it of the new display status.
