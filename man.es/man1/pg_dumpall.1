PG_DUMPALL(1)     PostgreSQL Client Applications    PG_DUMPALL(1)



NAME
       pg_dumpall  -  extract  all  PostgreSQL  databases  into a
       script file

SYNOPSIS
       pg_dumpall [ -c | --clean ] [ -g | --globals-only ]  [  -h
       host ] [ -p port ] [ -U username ] [ -W ]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_dumpall  is a utility for writing out (``dumping'') all
       PostgreSQL databases of a cluster into  one  script  file.
       The  script file contains SQL commands that can be used as
       input to psql(1) to restore the databases. It does this by
       calling   pg_dump(1)  for  each  database  in  a  cluster.
       pg_dumpall also dumps global objects that  are  common  to
       all  databases.   (pg_dump  does  not save these objects.)
       This currently includes  the  information  about  database
       users and groups.

       Thus,  pg_dumpall is an integrated solution for backing up
       your databases. But note  a  limitation:  it  cannot  dump
       ``large  objects'', since pg_dump cannot dump such objects
       into text files. If you have  databases  containing  large
       objects, they should be dumped using one of pg_dump's non-
       text output modes.

       Since pg_dumpall reads tables from all databases you  will
       most  likely  have  to  connect as a database superuser in
       order to produce a complete dump. Also you will need supe­
       ruser  privileges  to execute the saved script in order to
       be  allowed  to  add  users  and  groups,  and  to  create
       databases.

       The  SQL  script  will  be written to the standard output.
       Shell operators should be used to redirect it into a file.

   OPTIONS
       pg_dumpall accepts the following command line arguments:

       -c, --clean
              Include  SQL  commands  to  clean  (drop)  database
              objects before recreating  them.  (This  option  is
              fairly  useless, since the output script expects to
              create the databases themselves; they would  always
              be empty upon creation.)

       -g, --globals-only
              Only  dump  global  objects  (users and groups), no
              databases.

       -h host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              database  server  is running. If host begins with a
              slash, it is used as the  directory  for  the  Unix
              domain socket. The default is taken from the PGHOST
              environment variable, if set, else  a  Unix  domain
              socket connection is attempted.

       -p port
              The  port  number on which the server is listening.
              Defaults to the  PGPORT  environment  variable,  if
              set, or a compiled-in default.

       -U username
              Connect as the given user.

       -W     Force  a  password prompt. This should happen auto­
              matically if the server requires password authenti­
              cation.


       Any other command line parameters are passed to the under­
       lying pg_dump(1) calls. This is  useful  to  control  some
       aspects of the output format, but some options such as -f,
       -t, and dbname should be avoided.

EXAMPLES
       To dump all databases:

       $ pg_dumpall > db.out


       To reload this database use, for example:

       $ psql -f db.out template1

       (It is not important to which database  you  connect  here
       since  the  script file created by pg_dumpall will contain
       the appropriate commands to  create  and  connect  to  the
       saved databases.)
