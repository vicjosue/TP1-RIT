NAME
       pdftotext  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) to text con­
       verter (version 1.00)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftotext [options] [PDF-file [text-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftotext converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to
       plain text.

       Pdftotext  reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a text
       file, text-file.  If text-file is not specified, pdftotext
       converts  file.pdf  to file.txt.  If text-file is '-', the
       text is sent to stdout.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdftotext reads a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries  to  find the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.
       If that doesn't exist, it looks for a  system-wide  config
       file,  typically  /etc/xpdfrc  (but  this  location can be
       changed when pdftotext is built).  See the  xpdfrc(5)  man
       page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura­
       tion file commands.  These are listed in  square  brackets
       with  the  description  of  the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to convert.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to convert.

       -raw   Keep the text in content stream order.  This  is  a
              hack  which  often "undoes" column formatting, etc.
              This option will likely be replaced with  something
              more  sophisticated  when pdftotext is rewritten to
              use a smarter text placement algorithm.

       -htmlmeta
              Generate a simple HTML  file,  including  the  meta
              information.   This  simply wraps the text in <pre>
              and </pre> and prepends the meta headers.

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to  use  for  text  output.   The
              encoding-name  must  be defined with the unicodeMap
              command (see xpdfrc(5)).  This defaults to "Latin1"
              (which is a built-in encoding).  [config file: tex­
              tEncoding]

       -eol unix | dos | mac
              Sets the end-of-line convention  to  use  for  text
              output.  [config file: textEOL]

       -opw password
              Specify  the owner password for the PDF file.  Pro­
              viding this will bypass all security  restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't  print any messages or errors.  [config file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the  sys­
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print  usage  information.   (-help  and --help are
              equivalent.)

BUGS
       Some PDF files contain fonts  whose  encodings  have  been
       mangled  beyond  recognition.   There  is no way (short of
       OCR) to extract text from these files.
