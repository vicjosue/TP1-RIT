NAME
       gimp-remote  -  tells  a  running gimp to open a (local or
       remote) image file.

SYNOPSIS
       gimp-remote [-h] [--help] [-v]  [--version]  [-n]  [--new]
       filename...


DESCRIPTION
       gimp-remote  is  a small utility that tells a running gimp
       to open a (local or remote) image file.   It  does  so  by
       searching for a gimp toolbox on the active display.  If it
       can find a gimp toolbox, a synthetic drop event is created
       which  makes  gimp think the files would have been dropped
       onto the toolbox. More than one filename  or  URL  can  be
       specified on the commandline.


OPTIONS
       gimp-remote accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
               Display a list of all commandline options.

       -v, --version
               Output the version info.

       -n, --new
               If  no  running  gimp  is found, a new instance of
               gimp is started.  The files to open are passed  to
               the new gimp.


EXAMPLES
       gimp-remote http://www.gimp.org/icons/frontpage-small.gif
              Loads an image from the gimp webpage into a running
              gimp.

       gimp-remote -n wilber.xcf  wilma.xcf
              Loads the local files wilber.xcf and wilma.xcf into
              a  running  gimp.  If no gimp is running, a new one
              is started.


ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.
