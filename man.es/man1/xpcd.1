NAME
       xpcd - X11 program for reading PhotoCD-Images

SYNOPSIS
       xpcd [ mount-point | filename ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       xpcd  is an program for handling PhotoCDs. You can specify
       a *.pcd file or the  mount  point  of  a  PhotoCD  (simply
       "/cdrom"  for  example)  on  the  command line.  The usage
       should be straigtforward. If not:  there  is  some  online
       help, you get the help window with the F1 key.

       You  can  switch  language with the LANG environment vari­
       able, currently only english and german are available.

The GIMP and xpcd
       Everything you have to do is to install the xpcd-gate plu­
       gin  among the other plugins. The GIMP should come up with
       a new entry  "xpcd-gate"  in  the  extentions  menu.  This
       starts up a small bridge plug-in which allows xpcd to talk
       to The GIMP. Once the plug-in is running, xpcd  allows  to
       choose "The GIMP" in the Viewer menu.

CONFIGURATION
       xpcd  uses  /usr/lib/X11/system.xpcdrc or $HOME/.xpcdrc as
       configuration file. The global  config  file  should  hold
       some  useful  defaults.  xpcd will automatically save your
       current settings to your personal configuration file.

       jpeg_quality = [ 5 .. 100 ]
           Quality setting when saveing images with JPEG.  75  is
           the default, higher values give better quality.

       cdrom = [ string ]
           Mount point of the PhotoCD.

       display_gray = [ yes | no ]
           xpcd  displays the images grayscaled. Can be turned on
           and off in the options menu.

       load_gray = [ yes | no ]
           xpcd loads the images colored or  grayscaled.  Can  be
           turned  on  and off in the options menu. Don't confuse
           this with the previous one! xpcd's internal viewer can
           handle  images internally in color (save them in color
           for example), even if they are displayed in grayscale.

       Some other configuration options you can add to your .xpc­
       drc file (which are not autosaved) are:

       viewer = label, command-line
           configure a external viewer. You may  have  this  line
           more  than  once. label is the string which appears in
           the viewer menu, command-line is the command  line  of
           that  tool.  The  image is piped to the viewer, so the
           command line should tell that  the  image  comes  from
           stdin (often this is done by using a dash as argument,
           e.g. "xv -").

       disable_color = [ yes | no ]
           Disable colored display. This is useful if  you  think
           xpcd  eats  to  much colormap entries. Well, of cource
           you can't switch between colored and  grayscaled  dis­
           play then.

           This  is  turned  on  automatically for StaticGray and
           Grayscaled visuals or if there  are  not  enouth  free
           entries  in  your colormap with PseudoColor. For True­
           Color Visuals this switch has no effect.

       num_grays = [ 4 .. 64 ]
           Number of colormap entries to use for grayscaled  dis­
           play  (default:  8)  Less  than  8 colors looks really
           ugly, 32 usally enouth for good display quality.


BUGS
       Bugs are turned off.

       Seriously: If you find one, drop me a note. There are even
       some known bugs:

       I/O  errors  kill  xpcd  with  a SIGBUS. BTW: Is there any
       portable way to catch I/O errors on mmap(2)'ed files?

       You can exit xpcd even if the internal viewer is busy with
       saving a image. You'll end up with a tuncated file.
