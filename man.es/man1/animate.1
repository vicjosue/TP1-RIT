NAME
       animate - animate a sequence of images

SYNOPSIS
       animate [ options ...] file [ [ options ...] file ...]


DESCRIPTION
       Animate  displays  a sequence of images on any workstation
       display running an X server. animate first determines  the
       hardware capabilities of the workstation. If the number of
       unique colors in an image is less than  or  equal  to  the
       number the workstation can support, the image is displayed
       in an X window. Otherwise the  number  of  colors  in  the
       image  is  first  reduced to match the color resolution of
       the workstation before it is displayed.

       This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel  image
       can  display  on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome
       device. In most instances the reduced color image  closely
       resembles  the  original.  Alternatively,  a monochrome or
       pseudo-color image sequence can display on  a  continuous-
       tone 24 bits-per-pixel device.

       To  help  prevent  color flashing on X server visuals that
       have colormaps, animate creates a single colormap from the
       image sequence. This can be rather time consuming. You can
       speed this operation up by  reducing  the  colors  in  the
       image  before  you  `animate'  them.  Use mogrify to color
       reduce the images to a single colormap. See mogrify(1) for
       details.  Alternatively,  you can use a Standard Colormap;
       or a static, direct, or true color visual.  You can define
       a  Standard  Colormap  with  xstdcmap. See xstdcmap(1) for
       details. This method  is  recommended  for  colormapped  X
       server  because it eliminates the need to compute a global
       colormap.

EXAMPLES
       To animate a set of images of a cockatoo, use:


           animate cockatoo.*

       To animate a cockatoo image sequence while using the Stan­
       dard Colormap best, use:


           xstdcmap -best
           animate -map best cockatoo.*

       To  animate  an  image of a cockatoo without a border cen­
       tered on a backdrop, use:


           animate +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.*

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line  order.  Any  option
       you specify on the command line remains in effect until it
       is explicitly changed by specifying the option again  with
       a different effect.

       Animate  options can appear on the command line or in your
       X resources file. See X(1). Options on  the  command  line
       supersede values specified in your X resources file.

       -backdrop color
              display the image centered on a backdrop.

              This  backdrop covers the entire workstation screen
              and is useful for hiding other  X  window  activity
              while  viewing the image. The color of the backdrop
              is specified as the background color.  Refer  to  X
              Resources for details.


       -background color
              the background color

       -border <width>x<height>
              surround the image with a border of color

              See  X(1) for details about the geometry specifica­
              tion.


       -bordercolor color
              the border color

       -borderwidth color
              the border width

       -cache threshold
              megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

              Image  pixels  are  stored  in  memory   until   80
              megabytes  of memory have been consumed. Subsequent
              pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations  to
              memory  are  significantly  faster but if your com­
              puter does not have a  sufficient  amount  of  free
              memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.


       -chop <width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}
              remove pixels from the interior of an image

              The width and height give the number of columns and
              rows  to  remove, and the offsets give the location
              of the leftmost column and topmost row to remove.


              The -chop option removes entire rows  and  columns,
              and  moves the remaining corner blocks leftward and
              upward to close the gaps.


       -colormap type
              define the colormap type

              Choose between shared or private.


              This option only applies when the default X  server
              visual   is  PseudoColor  or  GRAYScale.  Refer  to
              -visual for more details. By default, a shared col­
              ormap  is  allocated.  The image shares colors with
              other  X  clients.   Some  image  colors  could  be
              approximated,  therefore  your  image may look very
              different than intended.  Choose  Private  and  the
              image  colors  appear  exactly as they are defined.
              However, other clients may go technicolor when  the
              image colormap is installed.

       -colors value
              preferred number of colors in the image

              The  actual  number  of  colors in the image may be
              less than your request, but never more. Note,  this
              is  a  color  reduction  option.  Images  with less
              unique colors than specified with this option  will
              have  any duplicate or unused colors removed. Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and  -treedepth
              affect the color reduction algorithm.


       -colorspace value
              the type of colorspace

              Choices  are:  GRAY,  OHTA,  RGB, Transparent, XYZ,
              YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, YUV, or CMYK.


              Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB
              color  space. Empirical evidence suggests that dis­
              tances in color spaces such as YUV  or  YIQ  corre­
              spond  to perceptual color differences more closely
              than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces
              may  give  better  results  when  color reducing an
              image.  Refer to quantize for more details.


              The Transparent color  space  behaves  uniquely  in
              that it preserves the matte channel of the image if
              it exists.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -crop <width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}
              preferred size and location of the cropped image

              See  X(1) for details about the geometry specifica­
              tion.


              The width and height give the  size  of  the  image
              that  remains  after cropping, and the offsets give
              the location of the top left corner of the  cropped
              image with respect to the original image.  To spec­
              ify the amount to be removed, use -shave instead.


              To specify a  percentage  width  or  height  to  be
              removed  instead, append %. For example to crop the
              image by ten percent (five percent on each side  of
              the image), use -crop 10%.


              Use  cropping to apply image processing options to,
              or display, a particular area of an image.


              Omit the x and y offset to  generate  one  or  more
              subimages of a uniform size.


              Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.
              Use -crop 0x0 to trim edges that are the background
              color.  Add an x and y offset to leave a portion of
              the trimmed edges with the image.


       -debug enable debug printout

       -delay <1/100ths of a second>
              display the next image after pausing

              This option is useful for regulating the  animation
              of  GIF  images  within Netscape. Delay/100 seconds
              must expire before the display of the  next  image.
              The default is no delay between each showing of the
              image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.


              You can specify a delay range (e.g. -delay  10-500)
              which sets the minimum and maximum delay.


       -density <width>x<height>
              vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the
              image

              This option specifies an image density when  decod­
              ing  a  PostScript  or  Portable Document page. The
              default is 72 dots per inch in the  horizontal  and
              vertical  direction. This option is used in concert
              with -page.


       -depth value
              depth of the image

              This is the number of bits in  a  pixel.  The  only
              acceptable  values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to
              specify the depth of  raw  images  whose  depth  is
              unknown  such  as  GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change
              the depth of any image after it has been read.


       -display host:display[.screen]
              specifies the X server to contact

       -dispose method
              GIF disposal method

              Here are the valid methods:


                   0     No disposal specified.
                   1     Do not dispose between frames.
                   2     Overwrite frame  with  background  color
              from header.
                   3     Overwrite with previous frame.

       -dissolve value
              dissolve an image

       -dither
              apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

              The  basic strategy of dithering is to trade inten­
              sity resolution for spatial resolution by averaging
              the  intensities  of  several  neighboring  pixels.
              Images which suffer  from  severe  contouring  when
              reducing colors can be improved with this option.


              The  -colors  or -monochrome option is required for
              this option to take effect.


              Use +dither to render Postscript  without  text  or
              graphic aliasing.


       -font name
              use this font when annotating the image with text

              You  can  tag  a  font  to  specify whether it is a
              Postscript, Truetype, or OPTION1 font.   For  exam­
              ple,  Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica is
              Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1.


       -foreground color
              define the foreground color

       -gamma value
              level of gamma correction

              The same color image  displayed  on  two  different
              workstations  may look different due to differences
              in the display monitor.  Use  gamma  correction  to
              adjust for this color difference. Reasonable values
              extend from 0.8 to 2.3.


              You can apply separate gamma  values  to  the  red,
              green,  and blue channels of the image with a gamma
              value   list   delineated   with   slashes    (i.e.
              1.7/2.3/1.2).


              Use +gamma value to set the image gamma level with­
              out  actually  adjusting  the  image  pixels.  This
              option  is  useful if the image is of a known gamma
              but  not  set  as  an  image  attribute  (e.g.  PNG
              images).


       -geometry    <width>x<height>{+-}<x   offset>{+-}<y   off­
       set>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
              preferred size and location of the Image window.

              See  X(1) for details about the geometry specifica­
              tion. By default, the window size is the image size
              and  the  location  is  chosen  by  you  when it is
              mapped.


              By  default,  the  width  and  height  are  maximum
              values.  That  is,  the  image  is expanded or con­
              tracted to fit the width  and  height  value  while
              maintaining  the  aspect ratio of the image. Append
              an exclamation point to the geometry to  force  the
              image  size  to  exactly  the size you specify. For
              example, if you specify 640x480! the image width is
              set  to  640  pixels and height to 480. If only one
              factor is specified,  both  the  width  and  height
              assume the value.


              To  specify  a  percentage width or height instead,
              append %. The image size is multiplied by the width
              and  height  percentages  to obtain the final image
              dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a
              value  greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an
              image's size, use a percentage less than 100.


              Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels  of  an
              image.


              Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification.  <
              resizes  the  image  only if its dimensions is less
              than the geometry specification.  For  example,  if
              you  specify  '640x480>'  and  the  image  size  is
              512x512, the image size does not  change.  However,
              if  the  image  is  1024x1024,  it  is  resized  to
              640x480.


              Use < to change the dimensions of the image only if
              its  size  exceeds  the  geometry  specification. >
              resizes the image only if its  dimensions  is  less
              than  the  geometry  specification. For example, if
              you specify 640x480> and the image size is 512x512,
              the  image  size  does  not change. However, if the
              image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.


              There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript  coordi­
              nates.


       -help  print usage instructions

       -iconGeometry geometry
              specify the icon geometry

       -iconic
              iconic animation

       -interlace type
              the type of interlacing scheme

              Choices  are:  None, Line, Plane, or Partition. The
              default is None.


              This option is used to specify the type  of  inter­
              lacing  scheme for raw image formats such as RGB or
              YUV. None means do not  interlace  (RGBRGBRGBRGBRG­
              BRGB...),    Line    uses    scanline   interlacing
              (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),  and  Plane
              uses                plane               interlacing
              (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).  Partition  is  like
              plane  except  the  different  planes  are saved to
              individual  files  (e.g.  image.R,   image.G,   and
              image.B).


              Use  Line,  or Plane to create an interlaced PNG or
              GIF or progressive JPEG image.


       -map type

              display image using this type.   [animate  or  dis­
              play]

              Choose from these Standard Colormap types:

                   best
                   default
                   gray
                   red
                   green
                   blue

              The X server must support the Standard Colormap you
              choose, otherwise an error occurs. Use list as  the
              type  and  display  searches  the  list of colormap
              types in top-to-bottom order until one is  located.
              See  xstdcmap(1)  for  one way of creating Standard
              Colormaps.

       -matte store matte channel if the image has one

              If the image does not have a matte channel,  create
              an opaque one.


       -mattecolor color
              specify the matte color

       -monochrome
              transform the image to black and white

       -name  name an image

       -pause seconds
              pause between animation loops

              Pause  for  the  specified number of seconds before
              repeating the animation.

       -remote
              perform a remote operation

              The only command recognized at  this  time  is  the
              name of an image file to load.


       -rotate degrees{<}{>}
              apply Paeth image rotation to the image

              Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds
              the height.  < rotates the image only if its  width
              is  less than the height. For example, if you spec­
              ify -90> and the image size is 480x640,  the  image
              is  not rotated by the specified angle. However, if
              the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.


              Empty  triangles  left over from rotating the image
              are filled with the  color  defined  as  background
              (class backgroundColor). See X(1) for details.


       -scene value{-value}
              image scene number or range

              Use this option to specify an image sequence with a
              single filename. See the discussion of  file  below
              for details.

       -shared_memory
              use shared memory

              This  resource specifies whether the utility should
              attempt use shared memory for pixmaps.  ImageMagick
              must  be  compiled  with shared memory support, and
              the display must  support  the  MIT-SHM  extension.
              Otherwise,  this  resource is ignored.  The default
              is True.


       -size <width>x<height>{+offset}
              width and height of the image

              Use this option to specify the width and height  of
              raw  images  whose  dimensions  are unknown such as
              GRAY, RGB,  or  CMYK.  In  addition  to  width  and
              height, use -size with an offset to skip any header
              information in the image or tell the number of col­
              ors  in a MAP image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally, use this option  to  choose  a  particular
              resolution  layer  of  a  JBIG  or JPEG image (e.g.
              -size 1024x768).


       -text_font name
              font for writing fixed-width text

              Specifies the name of the preferred font to use  in
              fixed   (typewriter  style)  formatted  text.   The
              default is 14 point Courier.


              You can tag a font  to  specify  whether  it  is  a
              Postscript,  Truetype,  or OPTION1 font.  For exam­
              ple, Courier.ttf is a Truetype font and x:fixed  is
              OPTION1.


       -title assign a title to the displayed image

              Use  this  option to assign a specific title to the
              image. This is assigned to the image window and  is
              typically   displayed  in  the  window  title  bar.
              Optionally you  can  include  the  image  filename,
              type,  width,  height,  or other image attribute by
              embedding special format characters:

                   %b file size
                   %c comment
                   %d directory
                   %e filename extention
                   %f filename
                   %h height
                   %i input filename
                   %k number of unique colors
                   %l label
                   %m magick
                   %n number of scenes
                   %o output filename
                   %p page number
                   %q quantum depth
                   %s scene number
                   %t top of filename
                   %u unique temporary filename
                   %w width
                   %x x resolution
                   %y y resolution
                   \n newline
                   \r carriage return

              For example,


                   -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image title of  MIFF:bird.miff  512x480
              for  an  image  titled bird.miff and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.


       -treedepth value
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero
              or  one  tells  display  to  choose an optimal tree
              depth for the color reduction algorithm

              An optimal depth generally allows the  best  repre­
              sentation of the source image with the fastest com­
              putational speed and the least  amount  of  memory.
              However,  the  default  depth  is inappropriate for
              some images. To assure the best representation, try
              values  between  2 and 8 for this parameter.  Refer
              to quantize for more details.


              The -colors or -monochrome option is  required  for
              this option to take effect.


       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is  printed: image scene number;
              image   name;   image   size;   the   image   class
              (DirectClass  or  PseudoClass); the total number of
              unique colors; and the number of  seconds  to  read
              and  transform  the  image.   Refer  to  miff for a
              description of the image class.


              If -colors is also specified, the total unique col­
              ors  in  the image and color reduction error values
              are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of
              these values.


       -visual type
              animate images using this X visual type

              Choose from these visual classes:


                   StaticGray
                   GrayScale
                   StaticColor
                   PseudoColor
                   TrueColor
                   DirectColor
                   default
                   visual id

              The  X  server  must support the visual you choose,
              otherwise an error occurs.   If  a  visual  is  not
              specified,  the  visual  class that can display the
              most simultaneous colors on the default  screen  is
              chosen.


       -window id
              make image the background of a window

              id  can  be  a  window id or name.  Specify root to
              select X's root window as the target window.


              By default the image is tiled onto  the  background
              of  the  target  window.   If backdrop or -geometry
              are specified, the image is surrounded by the back­
              ground color.  Refer to X RESOURCES for details.


              The  image  will  not display on the root window if
              the image has more unique colors  than  the  target
              window  colormap allows.  Use -colors to reduce the
              number of colors.


FILES AND FORMATS
       Any option you specify on  the  command  line  remains  in
       effect  until  it  is explicitly changed by specifying the
       option again with a different  effect.   For  example,  to
       animate  two images, the first with 32 colors and the sec­
       ond with only 16 colors, use:


            animate -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -colors 16 cockatoo.2

       By default, the image format is determined  by  its  magic
       number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the
       filename with an image  format  name  and  a  colon  (i.e.
       ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
       (i.e. image.ps). See convert(1) for a list of valid  image
       formats.

       When  you  specify  X as your image type, the filename has
       special meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name,  or
       root.  If no filename is specified, the window is selected
       by clicking the mouse in the desired window.

       Specify file as - for standard  input,  If  file  has  the
       extension or .gz, the file is uncompressed with uncompress
       or gunzip respectively. Precede the image file name with |
       to pipe from a system command.

       Use  an  optional  index enclosed in brackets after a file
       name to specify a desired subimage of  a  multi-resolution
       image  format  like  Photo  CD (e.g.  img0001.pcd[4]) or a
       range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]). A  subimage
       specification  can  be  disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]).
       For raw images, specify a subimage with a  geometry  (e.g.
       -size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

       Single  images  are  read  with  the filename you specify.
       Alternatively, you can animate an image  sequence  with  a
       single  filename.  Define  the range of the image sequence
       with -scene. Each image in the  range  is  read  with  the
       filename  followed  by  a period (.) and the scene number.
       You can change this behavior by embedding a printf  format
       specification in the file name. For example,


           -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff

       animates   files   image00.miff,   image01.miff,   through
       image09.miff.  Image filenames may appear in any order  on
       the  command  line  if  the image format is MIFF (refer to
       miff(5) and the scene keyword is specified in  the  image.
       Otherwise the images will display in the order they appear
       on the command line.

X RESOURCES
       Animate options can appear on the command line or in  your
       X  resource  file.  Options  on the command line supersede
       values specified in your X resource  file.  See  X(1)  for
       more information on X resources.

       All  animate  options  have a corresponding X resource. In
       addition,  the  animate  program  uses  the  following   X
       resources:

               background (class Background)


                    Specifies  the preferred color to use for the
                    Image window background. The default is #ccc.
               borderColor (class BorderColor)


                    Specifies  the preferred color to use for the
                    Image window border. The default is #ccc.
               borderWidth (class BorderWidth)


                    Specifies the width in pixels  of  the  Image
                    window border. The default is 2.
               font (class Font or FontList)


                    Specifies  the  name of the preferred font to
                    use in normal formatted text.  The default is
                    14 point Helvetica.
               foreground (class Foreground)


                    Specifies the preferred color to use for text
                    within the  Image  window.   The  default  is
                    black.
               geometry (class geometry)


                    Specifies  the preferred size and position of
                    the  image  window.  It  is  not  necessarily
                    obeyed by all window managers.
               iconGeometry (class IconGeometry)


                    Specifies  the preferred size and position of
                    the application when iconified.   It  is  not
                    necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
               iconic (class Iconic)


                    This resource indicates that you would prefer
                    that the application's windows initially  not
                    be  visible  as if the windows had be immedi­
                    ately iconified by you. Window  managers  may
                    choose   not   to   honor  the  application's
                    request.
               matteColor (class MatteColor)


                    Specify the color of windows. It is used  for
                    the   backgrounds   of  windows,  menus,  and
                    notices. A 3D effect  is  achieved  by  using
                    highlight and shadow colors derived from this
                    color. Default value: #ddd.
               name (class Name)


                    This resource specifies the name under  which
                    resources   for  the  application  should  be
                    found.  This  resource  is  useful  in  shell
                    aliases to distinguish between invocations of
                    an application, without resorting to creating
                    links  to alter the executable file name. The
                    default is the application name.
               sharedMemory (class SharedMemory)


                    This  resource  specifies   whether   animate
                    should attempt use shared memory for pixmaps.
                    ImageMagick must be compiled with shared mem­
                    ory support, and the display must support the
                    MIT-SHM extension. Otherwise,  this  resource
                    is ignored. The default is True.
               text_font (class textFont)


                    Specifies  the  name of the preferred font to
                    use in  fixed  (typewriter  style)  formatted
                    text. The default is 14 point Courier.
               title (class Title)


                    This  resource specifies the title to be used
                    for the Image  window.  This  information  is
                    sometimes used by a window manager to provide
                    some sort of header identifying  the  window.
                    The default is the image file name.
