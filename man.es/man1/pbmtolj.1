NAME
       pbmtolj  - convert a portable bitmap into HP LaserJet for­
       mat

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolj [-resolution N]  [-float]  [-noreset]  [-packbits]
       [-delta] [-compress] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  bitmap as input.  Produces HP LaserJet
       data as output.

       Note that there is no ljtopbm tool.

OPTIONS
       -resolution
              Specifies the resolution of the output  device,  in
              dpi.   Typical  values  are  75, 100, 150, 300, and
              600.  The default is 75.

       -float Suppresses positioning information.  The default is
              to  write  the  sequence  ESC & l 0 E to the output
              file.

       -noreset
              Prevents pbmtolj from writing the  reset  sequences
              to the beginning and end of the output file.

       -packbits
              Enables use of TIFF packbits compression.

       -delta Enables use of delta-between-rows compression.

       -compress
              Enables  use  of  both  TIFF  packbits,  and delta-
              between-rows compression.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique pre­
       fix.
