NAME
       dlpsh - command shell for executing DLP commands to a Palm
       Device

SYNOPSIS
       dlpsh /dev/cua?

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the  small  application  dlpsh.
       dlpsh  allows  the  user to connect to a Pilot and execute
       arbitrary Data Link Protocol (DLP)  commands  to  a  Pilot
       connected  to the specified callout device.  Once dlpsh is
       started, the  user  must  invoke  HotSync  on  the  target
       device.   Once  connected, the user may execute any of the
       built-in DLP commands. (See BUILT-IN COMMANDS).  The  con­
       nection  to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a PadTickle
       packet to the Pilot after a small period of  non-activity.
       (7 seconds by default)
