       --help display this help and exit

       --version

       Read standard input if FILE is -.  Each PATTERN may be:

       INTEGER
              copy up to but not including specified line number

       /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
              copy up to but not including a matching line

       %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
              skip to, but not including a matching line

       {INTEGER}
              repeat the previous  pattern  specified  number  of
              times

       {*}    repeat the previous pattern as many times as possi­
