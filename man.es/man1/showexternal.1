NAME
       showexternal  -  Fetch and display the body of a mail mes­
       sage that is included by reference

SYNOPSIS
       showexternal  body-file access-type name [site  [directory
       [mode [server]]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  showexternal  program will attempt to obtain the real
       body of a mail message that is included only by reference,
       using   the  MIME  type  "message/external-body".   It  is
       intended to be called by metamail via a mailcap entry like
       the following:

       message/external-body;   showexternal   %s  %{access-type}
       %{name} %{site} %{directory} %{mode} %{server} ; needster­
       minal

       If  it succeeds in fetching the message body, showexternal
       will then call metamail to actually display it.

SEE ALSO
       metamail(1)

ENVIRONMENT
       The FTP environment variable can  override  "ftp"  as  the
       name of the ftp program.

BUGS
       Not the greatest error handling in the world.
