DESCRIPTION
       --ansi Use  ANSI  SQL  syntax instead of MySQL syntax. See
              section 5.2 Running MySQL in ANSI Mode.

       -b|--basedir=path
              Path to installation directory. All paths are  usu­
              ally resolved relative to this.

       --big-tables
              Allow  big result sets by saving all temporary sets
              on file. It solves most 'table  full'  errors,  but
              also  slows down the queries where in-memory tables
              would suffice. Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL is  able
              to  solve it automaticaly by using memory for small
              temporary tables and switching to disk tables where
              necessary.

       --bind-address=IP
              IP address to bind to.

       --character-sets-dir=path
              Directory  where  character  sets  are. See section
              10.1.1 The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting.

       --chroot=path
              Chroot  mysqld  daemon  during startup. Recommended
              security measure. It will somewhat limit LOAD  DATA
              INFILE and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE though.

       -h|--datadir=path
              Path to the database root.

       --default-character-set=charset
              Set  the  default character set. See section 10.1.1
              The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting.

       --default-table-type=type
              Set the default table type for tables. See  section
              8 MySQL Table Types.

       --delay-key-write-for-all-tables
              Don't  flush  key  buffers  between  writes for any
              MyISAM table. See Mysql Manual section 12.2.3  Tun­
              ing Server Parameters.

       --enable-locking
              Enable system locking.

       -T|--exit-info
              Print some debug info at exit.

       --flush
              Flush  all  changes to disk after each SQL command.
              Normally MySQL only does a write of all changes  to
              disk  after each SQL command and lets the operating
              system handle the syncing to disk. See section 20.2
              What to Do if MySQL Keeps Crashing.

       -?|--help
              Display short help and exit.

       --init-file=file
              Read SQL commands from this file at startup.

       -L|--language=...
              Client  error  messages  in  given language. May be
              given as a full path. See Mysql Manual section 10.1
              What Languages Are Supported by MySQL?.

       -l|--log[=file]
              Log connections and queries to file.

       --log-isam[=file]
              Log all ISAM/MyISAM changes to file (only used when
              debugging ISAM/MyISAM).

       --log-slow-queries[=file]
              Log  all  queries  that  have   taken   more   than
              long_query_time  seconds  to  execute  to file. See
              Mysql Manual section 21.5 The Slow Query Log.

       --log-update[=file]
              Log updates to file.# where # is a unique number if
              not given. See Mysql Manual section 21.3 The Update
              Log.

       --log-long-format
              Log some extra information to update  log.  If  you
              are  using --log-slow-queries then queries that are
              not using indexes are logged to the slow query log.

       --low-priority-updates
              Table-modifying  operations  (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE)
              will have lower priority than selects. It can  also
              be  done  via  {INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE}
              LOW_PRIORITY ... to lower the priority of only  one
              query,  or by SET OPTION SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1
              to change the priority in  one  thread.  See  Mysql
              Manual section  12.2.9 Table Locking Issues.

       --memlock
              Lock  the mysqld process in memory. This works only
              if your system supports the mlockall() system call.
              This may help if you have a problem where the oper­
              ating system is causing mysqld to swap on disk.

        --myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]] where  option  is
       one of DEFAULT, BACKUP, FORCE or QUICK.
              If this option is used, mysqld will on  open  check
              if  the  table  is  marked  as crashed or if if the
              table wasn't closed properly (The last option  only
              works  if  you are running with --skip-locking). If
              this is the case  mysqld  will  run  check  on  the
              table.  If  the  table  was  corrupted, mysqld will
              attempt to repair it. The following options affects
              how the repair works.  DEFAULT The same as not giv­
              ing any option to --myisam-recover.  BACKUP If  the
              data  table  was  changed  during  recover,  save a
              backup  of  the  `table_name.MYD'  data   file   as
              `table_name-datetime.BAK'.   FORCE Run recover even
              if we will loose more than one row  from  the  .MYD
              file.   QUICK  Don't check the rows in the table if
              there isn't any delete blocks.  Before a  table  is
              automaticly  repaired, mysqld will add a note about
              this in the error log. If you want to  be  able  to
              recover from most things without user intervention,
              you should use the options BACKUP,FORCE. This  will
              force  a  repair of a table even if some rows would
              be deleted, but it will keep the old data file as a
              backup so that you can later examine what happened.

       --pid-file=path
              Path to pid file used by safe_mysqld.

       -P|--port=...
              Port number to listen for TCP/IP connections.

       -o|--old-protocol
              Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility  with  some
              very  old clients. See Mysql Manual section  4.17.3
              Upgrading from Version 3.20 to Version 3.21.

       --one-thread
              Only use one thread (for  debugging  under  Linux).
              See  Mysql  Manual  section   H.1 Debugging a MySQL
              server.

       -O| --set-variable var=option
              Give a variable a value.  --help  lists  variables.
              You  can  find a full description for all variables
              in the SHOW VARIABLES section in this  manual.  See
              Mysql  Manual  section   7.28.4 SHOW VARIABLES. The
              tuning server parameters section includes  informa­
              tion  of  how  to  optimize these. See Mysql Manual
              section  12.2.3 Tuning Server Parameters.

       -Sg|--skip-grant-tables
              This option causes the server not to use the privi­
              lege system at all. This gives everyone full access
              to all databases! (You can tell a running server to
              start  using  the  grant  tables again by executing
              mysqladmin flush-privileges or mysqladmin  reload.)

       --safe-mode
              Skip      some     optimize     stages.     Implies
              --skip-delay-key-write.

       --secure
              IP numbers returned by the  gethostbyname()  system
              call  are checked to make sure they resolve back to
              the original hostname. This  makes  it  harder  for
              someone  on the outside to get access by pretending
              to be another host. This option also adds some san­
              ity  checks  of hostnames. The option is turned off
              by default in MySQL Version 3.21 because  sometimes
              it  takes  a  long time to perform backward resolu­
              tions. MySQL Version 3.22 caches hostnames  (unless
              --skip-host-cache  is  used)  and  has  this option
              enabled by default.

       --skip-concurrent-insert
              Turn off the ability to select and  insert  at  the
              same  time  on  MyISAM  tables. (This is only to be
              used if you think you have found a bug in this fea­
              ture).

       --skip-delay-key-write
              Ignore  the  delay_key_write option for all tables.
              See Mysql  Manual  section   12.2.3  Tuning  Server
              Parameters.

       --skip-locking
              Don't use system locking. To use isamchk or myisam­
              chk you must shut down the server. See Mysql Manual
              section   1.6  How  Stable  Is MySQL?. Note that in
              MySQL Version 3.23 you can use REPAIR and CHECK  to
              repair/check MyISAM tables.

       --skip-name-resolve
              Hostnames  are not resolved. All Host column values
              in the grant tables must be IP  numbers  or  local­
              host.

       --skip-networking
              Don't  listen  for  TCP/IP  connections at all. All
              interaction with mysqld must be made via Unix sock­
              ets.  This option is highly recommended for systems
              where only local  requests  are  allowed.  However,
              this  option  is  unsuitable  for  systems that use
              MIT-pthreads,  because  the  MIT-pthreads   package
              doesn't support Unix sockets.

       --skip-new
              Don't  use  new,  possible  wrong routines. Implies
              --skip-delay-key-write

       --skip-host-cache
              Never use host name cache for faster name-ip  reso­
              lution,  but  query  DNS  server  on  every connect
              instead.

       --skip-show-database
              Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE'  commands,  unless  the
              user has process privilege.

       --skip-thread-priority
              Disable using thread priorities for faster response
              time.

       --socket=path
              Socket file to use for local connections instead of
              default /tmp/mysql.sock.

       -t|--tmpdir=path
              Path  for temporary files. It may be useful if your
              default /tmp directory resides on a  partition  too
              small to hold temporary tables.

       -u|--user=user_name
              Run mysqld daemon as user user_name. This option is
              mandatory when starting mysqld as root.

       -V|--version
              Output version information and exit.
