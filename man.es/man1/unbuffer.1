UNBUFFER(1)                                           UNBUFFER(1)



NAME
       unbuffer - unbuffer output

SYNOPSIS
       unbuffer program [ args ]

INTRODUCTION
       unbuffer  disables  the  output buffering that occurs when
       program output is redirected.  For  example,  suppose  you
       are  watching the output from a fifo by running it through
       od and then more.

            od -c /tmp/fifo | more

       You will not see anything until a full page of output  has
       been produced.

       You can disable this automatic buffering as follows:


            unbuffer od -c /tmp/fifo | more


BUGS
       The man page is longer than the program.
