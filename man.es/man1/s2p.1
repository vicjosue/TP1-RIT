       s2p takes a sed script specified on the command line (or
       from standard input) and produces a comparable perl script
       on the standard output.

            prepended to the front of the script.

            the front of the script.

       The perl script produced looks very sed-ish, and there may
       very well be better ways to express what you want to do in
       perl.  For instance, s2p does not make any use of the
       split operator, but you might want to.

       The perl script you end up with may be either faster or
       slower than the original sed script.  If you're only
       interested in speed you'll just have to try it both ways.
       Of course, if you want to do something sed doesn't do, you
       have no choice.  It's often possible to speed up the perl
       script by various methods, such as deleting all references
       to $\ and chop.
