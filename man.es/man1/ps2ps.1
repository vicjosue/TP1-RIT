PS2PS(1)                Ghostscript Tools                PS2PS(1)



NAME
       ps2ps - Ghostscript PostScript "distiller"

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ps [ options ] input.ps output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps uses gs(1) to convert PostScript(tm) file "input.ps"
       to simpler and (usually) faster PostScript in "output.ps".
       Normally  the  output is allowed to use PostScript Level 2
       constructs, but the -dLanguageLevel=1 option restricts the
       output to Level 1.

       Use  ps2ps  only  for  ordinary PostScript (PS) files; for
       Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, use eps2eps.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documenta­
       tion  on your system, from which you can get more details.

VERSION
