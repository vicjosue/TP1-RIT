NAME
       BitchX - The Ultimate IRC Client

SYPNOSIS
       BitchX [-aAbBcdfFHlLnNpPqrvxZ]

DESCRIPTION
       BitchX  is  a  VERY  heavily  modified  ircII  client.  It
       includes many things such as built in CDCC  (XDCC)  offer­
       ing,  built  in  flood  protection,  etc.  It is easier to
       script things in  BitchX  because  unlike  plain,  vanilla
       ircII,  half  the  script  does  not have to be devoted to
       changing the appearance of ircII.  It also  includes  many
       other new features, such as port scanning, advanced TCL, a
       CD player, a mail client, screening process, etc.

       BitchX - Based on EPIC Software Labs  epic  ircII  (1998).
       Version BitchX-1.0 -- Date (19990221).

       This  man  page  was modified from the existing Debian man
       page.

ENVIRONMENT
       BitchX uses  many environmental variables to configure the
              client.  These can be set by editing  your  ~/.pro­
              file  or ~/.bash_login (if you're using a /bin/bash
              shell) and adding ``export  VARNAME="var  value"''.
              Or,  if  you  are using the /bin/tcsh shell you can
              set these by editing ~/.tcshrc and adding  ``setenv
              VARNAME  "var  value"''.   Below is a list of vari­
              ables.
