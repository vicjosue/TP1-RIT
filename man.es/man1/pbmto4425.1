PBMTO4425(1)                                         PBMTO4425(1)



NAME
       pbmto4425 - Display PBM images on an AT&T 4425 terminal

SYNOPSIS
       pbmto4425 [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Pbmto4425 displays PBM format images on an AT&T 4425 ASCII
       terminal using that terminal's mosaic  graphics  character
       set.   The  program should also work with other VT100-like
       terminals with mosaic graphics character sets such as  the
       C.  Itoh CIT-101, but it has not yet been tested on termi­
       nals other than the 4425.

       Pbmto4425 puts  the  terminal  into  132  column  mode  to
       achieve  the  maximum resolution of the terminal.  In this
       mode the terminal has a resolution of 264  columns  by  69
       rows.  The pixels have an aspect ratio of 1:2.6, therefore
       an image should be processed before being displayed  in  a
       manner such as this:

              % pnmscale -xscale 2.6 pnmfile \
                     | pnmscale -xysize 264 69 \
                     | ppmtopgm \
                     | pgmtopbm \
                     | pbmto4425
