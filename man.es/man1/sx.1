NAME
       osx  - An SGML System Conforming to International Standard
       ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       osx [-Cehilprvx] [-bencoding] [-ccatalog_file] [-Ddirectory] [-ffile] [-wwarning_type] [-xxml_output_option...] [sysid...]



DESCRIPTION
       osx converts SGML to XML. osx  parses  and  validates  the
       SGML  document contained in sysid and writes an equivalent
       XML document to the standard output. osx will  warn  about
       SGML constructs which have no XML equivalent.


OPTIONS
       The following options are available:



          -bencoding

              Use encoding for output. By default osx uses UTF-8.



          -cfile

              Use the catalog entry file file.



          -C   This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).



          -Ddirectory

              Search directory  for  files  specified  in  system
              identifiers.  This  has  the same effect as in ons­
              gmls(1).



          -e   Describe open entities in error messages.



          -ffile

              Redirect errors to file. This is useful mainly with
              shells that do not support redirection of stderr.



          -iname

              This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).



          -v   Print the version number.



          -wtype

              Control warnings and errors according to type. This
              has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).



          -xxml_output_option

              Control the XML output according to  the  value  of
              xml_output_option as follows:

              no-nl-in-tag  Don't use newlines inside start-tags.
              Usually osx uses newlines inside start-tags  so  as
              to  reduce  the  probability  of  excessively  long
              lines.

              id Output attribute declarations for ID attributes.

              notation Output declarations for notations.

              ndata  Output  declarations for external data enti­
              ties. XML requires these to be NDATA. osx will warn
              about  CDATA  and  SDATA external data entities and
              output them as NDATA entities.

              cdata Use XML CDATA sections for CDATA marked  sec­
              tions  and  for elements with a declared content of
              CDATA.

              comment Output comment declarations. Comment decla­
              rations in the DTD will not be output.

              lower  Prefer lower case. Names that were subjected
              to upper-case substitution by SGML will  be  folded
              to  lower  case.  This  does  not  include reserved
              names; XML requires these to be in upper-case.

              pi-escape Escape &<> in the contents of  processing
              instructions  using  the  amp,  lt and gt entities.
              This allows processing instructions to contain  the
              string  >?,  but  requires that applications handle
              the escapes.

              empty Use the  <e/>  syntax  for  element  types  e
              declared as EMPTY.

              attlis Output an ATTLIST declaration for every ele­
              ment specifying the type  of  all  attributes.  The
              default will always be #IMPLIED.

              Multiple -x options are allowed.
