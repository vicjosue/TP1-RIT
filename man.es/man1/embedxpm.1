       embedxpm can be used to embed xpm pictures directly into a
       perl program. To do this, your program source has to con­
       tain some markers (in the form of comments) that describe
       the position where the picture should be inserted.  To
       only insert the xpm data, use this form:

        #%XPM:<name of xpm>%
        <your xpm data goes here>
        #%XPM%<what to attach to the end of the data>

       Here is an example (taken from the Gimp/PDB program):

        C<# create the logo pixmap for the given widget
        sub create_logo($) {
           new Gtk::Pixmap(Gtk::Gdk::Pixmap->create_from_xpm_d(
              $_[0]->window,
              $_[0]->style->black,
              #%XPM:logo%
              'xpm data', 'xpm data...',...
              #%XPM%
           ))
        }>

       To insert the xpm with the name example.xpm into this
       source you would have to use the following commandline:

        embedxpm example.xpm source.pl logo

       WARNING: embedxpm happily overwrites your source, without
       leaving a backup-copy around(!). If anything goes wrong
       (for example when you left out the end comment) your
       source may be lost, so better make a backup before. I am
       not responsible for your data-loss!
