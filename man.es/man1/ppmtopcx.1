NAME
       ppmtopcx - convert a portable pixmap into a PCX file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopcx [-24bit] [-packed] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a PCX file as
       output.  The type of the PCX file depends on the number of
       colors in the pixmap:

       16 colors or less:
              1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes.

       256 colors or less:
              8  bits/pixel,  1 plane, colormap at the end of the
              file.

       More than 256 colors:
              24bit truecolor file (8 bits/pixel, 3 planes).

OPTIONS
       -24bit Produce a 24bit truecolor file, even if the  pixmap
              has 256 colors or less.

       -packed
              Use  "packed pixel" format for files with 16 colors
              or less: 1, 2, or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane.
