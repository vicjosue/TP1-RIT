NAME
       urlview - URL extractor/launcher

SYNOPSIS
       urlview filename [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       urlview  is  a screen oriented program for extracting URLs
       from text files and displaying a menu from which  you  may
       launch a command to view a specific item.

CONFIGURATION
       urlview attempts to read ~/.urlview upon startup.  If this
       file doesn't exist, it will try to read a system wide file
       in  /etc/urlview.conf.   There  are two configuration com­
       mands (order does not matter):

       REGEXP regexp
              urlview uses a regular expression to  extract  URLs
              from  the  specified text files.  \r, \t, \n and \f
              are all converted to their normal  printf(3)  mean­
              ings.  The default REGEXP is:


       (((https?|ftp|gopher)://|(mailto|file|news):)[^' <>"]+|(www|web|w3).[-a-z0-9.]+)[^' .,;<>":]


       COMMAND command
              If  the specified command contains a %s, it will be
              subsituted with the URL that was requested,  other­
              wise  the  URL  is  appended to the COMMAND string.
              The default COMMAND is:

              url_handler.sh %s

       Note: You should never put single quotes  around  the  %s.
       urlview does this for you, and also makes sure that single
       quotes eventually showing up inside the  URL  are  handled
       properly.   (Note  that  this  shouldn't  happen  with the
       default regular expression, which explicitly excludes sin­
       gle quotes.)

FILES
       /etc/urlview.conf
              system-wide urlview configuration file

       ~/.urlview
              urlview configuration file
