UUIDGEN(1)                                             UUIDGEN(1)



NAME
       uuidgen - command-line utility to create a new UUID value

SYNOPSIS
       uuidgen [ -r | -t ]

DESCRIPTION
       The uuidgen program creates a new universally unique iden­
       tifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3) library.  The new  UUID
       can  reasonably  be considered unique among all UUIDs cre­
       ated on the local system, and among UUIDs created on other
       systems in the past and in the future.

       There  are two types of UUID's which uuidgen can generate:
       time-based UUID's and  random-based  UUID's.   By  default
       uuidgen  will generate a random-based UUID if a high-qual­
       ity random number generator  is  present.   Otherwise,  it
       will chose a time-based UUID.  It is possible to force the
       generation of one of these two UUID types by using the  -r
       or -t options.

OPTIONS
       -r     Generate  a random-based UUID.  This method creates
              a  UUID  consisting  mostly  of  random  bits.   It
              requires  that  the  operating  system  have a high
              quality random number generator, such as  /dev/ran­
              dom.

       -t     Generate  a time-based UUID.  This method creates a
              UUID based on the system clock  plus  the  system's
              ethernet hardware address, if present.

RETURN VALUE
       The  UUID of the form 1b4e28ba-2fa1-11d2-883f-b9a761bde3fb
       (in printf(3) format "%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x") is  out­
       put to the standard output.
