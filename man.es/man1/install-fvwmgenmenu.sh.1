NAME
       install-fvwmgenmenu.sh:  don't use! It used to be for com­
       patibility with menu-methods that were over  2  year  old,
       but  that  compatibility support has been removed now. So,
       now install-fvwmgenmenu is a binary that calls the  script
       install-fvwmgenmenu.sh,  that tells the user/system admin­
       istrator to update his/her menu-methods.

       Public License.  (GPL 2.0 or greater).
