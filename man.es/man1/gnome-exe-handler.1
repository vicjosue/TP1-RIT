NAME
       gnome-exe-handler - GNOME executable Mime type Handler.

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-exe-handler file1 file2...

DESCRIPTION
       The  gnome-exe-handler  program is invoked by applications
       that try to launch executables in Unix but do not have the
       execution  permission  bit set.  The are classified as ELF
       or A.OUT executables by the MIME system.

       gnome-exe-handler Would let the user double  click  on  an
       application  and  if  the user confirms the action, change
       the permissions automatically for him and then launch  the
       application.   This is particulary useful when downloading
       software from the network, as Unix will not  transfer  the
       execution  permissions.   This  simplifies  the  number of
       steps that a novice user has to take to run software  from
       the net.
