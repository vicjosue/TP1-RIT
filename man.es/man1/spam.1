NAME
       ospam  -  An SGML System Conforming to International Stan­
       dard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       ospam [-Cehilprvx] [-ccatalog_file] [-Ddirectory]
             [-ffile] [-mmarkup_option] [-oentity_name]
             [-wwarning_type] [sysid...]


DESCRIPTION
       ospam (OpenJade SP Add Markup) is an  SGML  markup  stream
       editor  implemented  using the OpenSP parser. ospam parses
       the SGML document contained in sysid  and  copies  to  the
       standard  output  the  portion of the document entity con­
       taining the document instance, adding or  changing  markup
       as  specified by the -m options. The -p option can be used
       to include the SGML declaration and prolog in the  output.
       The -o option can be used to output other entities. The -x
       option can be used to expand entity references.


       The following options are available:


       -cfile Use the catalog entry file file.


       -C     This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -Ddirectory
              Search directory  for  files  specified  in  system
              identifiers.  This  has  the same effect as in ons­
              gmls(1).


       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.


       -ffile Redirect errors to file. This is useful mainly with
              shells that do not support redirection of stderr.


       -h     Hoist  omitted  tags out from the start of internal
              entities. If the text at the beginning of an inter­
              nal entity causes a tag to be implied, the tag will
              usually  be  treated  as  being  in  that  internal
              entity;  this  option  will  instead cause it to be
              treated as being in the entity that referenced  the
              internal  entity. This option makes a difference in
              conjunction with -momittag or -x -x.


       -iname This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -l     Prefer lower-case. Added names that were subject to
              upper-case substitution will be converted to lower-
              case.


       -mmarkup_option
              Change the markup in the output  according  to  the
              value of markup_option as follows:

              omittag  Add  tags  that were omitted using omitted
              tag  minimization.  End  tags  that  were   omitted
              because the element has a declared content of EMPTY
              or an explicit content reference will not be added.

              shortref  Replace  short references by named entity
              references.

              net Change null end-tags into unminimized end-tags,
              and change net-enabling start-tags into unminimized
              start-tags.

              emptytag Change empty tags into unminimized tags.

              unclosed  Change  unclosed  tags  into  unminimized
              tags.

              attname Add omitted attribute names and vis.

              attvalue   Add   literal  delimiters  omitted  from
              attribute values.

              attspec Add omitted attribute specifications.

              current Add omitted  attribute  specifications  for
              current  attributes.  This option is implied by the
              attspec option.

              shorttag Equivalent to combination of  net,  empty­
              tag,   unclosed,   attname,  attvalue  and  attspec
              options.

              rank Add omitted rank suffixes.

              reserved Put reserved names in upper-case.

              ms Remove marked section declarations whose  effec­
              tive status is IGNORE, and replace each marked sec­
              tion declaration whose effective status is  INCLUDE
              by  its  marked  section. In the document instance,
              empty comments will be added before  or  after  the
              marked  section  declaration to ensure that ignored
              record ends remain ignored.

              Multiple -m options are allowed.


       -oname Output the general entity name instead of the docu­
              ment  entity.  The  output  will  correspond to the
              first time that the entity is  referenced  in  con­
              tent.


       -p     Output  the  part of the document entity containing
              the SGML declaration (if it was explicitly  present
              in  the document entity) and the prolog before any­
              thing else. If this option is specified two or more
              times, then all entity references occurring between
              declarations in the prolog will be  expanded;  this
              includes  the implicit reference to the entity con­
              taining the external subset of the DTD, if there is
              one.  Note  that  the  SGML declaration will not be
              included if it was specified by an  SGMLDECL  entry
              in a catalog.


       -r     Don't  perform  any  conversion on RSs and REs when
              outputting the entity. The entity  would  typically
              have the storage manager attribute records=asis.


       -v     Print the version number.


       -wtype Control warnings and errors according to type. This
              has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -x     Expand references to entities that are changed.  If
              this  option  is  specified two or more times, then
              all references to entities that contain  tags  will
              be expanded.


BUGS
       Omitted tags are added at the point where they are implied
       by the SGML parser (except as modified by the -h  option);
       this is often not quite where they are wanted.


       The case of general delimiters is not preserved.


       Incorrect  results  may  be produced if a variant concrete
       syntax is used which is such that there are delimiters  in
       markup  to  be  added  that have a prefix that is a proper
       suffix of some other delimiter.


       If an entity reference in a default value uses the default
       entity  and  an  entity  with  that  name  is subsequently
       defined and that default value is added  to  the  document
       instance,  then  the resulting document may not be equiva­
       lent to the original document. ospam will give  a  warning
       when the first two conditions are met.
