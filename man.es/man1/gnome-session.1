gnome-session - Starts up the GNOME desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-session   [--choosesession]  [--failsafe]  [--purge-
       delay=DELAY] [--warn-delay=DELAY]  [--suicide-delay=DELAY]
       [session-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gnome-session  program  starts  up  the GNOME desktop
       environment.  This command is typically executed  by  your
       login  manager  (either  gdm,  xdm, or from your X startup
       scripts).  It will load either your last  session,  or  it
       will  provide a default session for the user as defined by
       the system administrator (or the default  GNOME  installa­
       tion on your system).

       You  can  optionally  specify  a  specific session name to
       restore.

       gnome-session is an X11R6 session manager.  It can  manage
       GNOME applications as well as any X11R6 SM compliant.

       gnome-session  uses  the contents of the  ~/.gnome/session
       file for starting up as specified by  the  "Current  Sess­
       sion"  key  in the ~/.gnome/session-options file.  Various
       default values are provided in case the  file  entry  does
       not exist.

       If the session file does not exist, gnome-session will use
       the contents of the /usr/share/gnome/default.session file.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --choose-session=ARG
              User  can  specify a session to load, as opposed to
              the  session  specified  in  the  ~/.gnome/session-
              options  file.  If that entry does not exist in the
              ~/.gnome/session file  (or  if  that  file  doesn't
              exist),  it  will  use  the default session and all
              saves to that session will be to  the  new  session
              name.

       --failsafe
              Fail  safe  operations  mode: only reads saved ses­
              sions from the default.session file.

       --purge-delay=ARG
              The number of millisecond that  gnome-session  will
              wait  for clients to register, if you use 0 it will
              wait forever (default value: 30,000  milliseconds).

       --warn-delay=ARG
              The  number  of millisecond that gnome-session will
              wait for clients to respond, if you use 0  it  will
              wait  forever (default value: 10,000 milliseconds).

       --suicide-delay=ARG
              The number of millisecond that  gnome-session  will
              wait  for clients to die, if you use 0 it will wait
              forever (default value: 10,000 milliseconds).

ENVIRONMENT
       gnome-session accepts  all  of  the  standard  environment
       variables  used  by  gnome  programs,  other than the SES­
       SION_MANAGER environment variable. [  xref  to  a  manpage
       where  this  is documented. ] gnome-session also sets sev­
       eral environment variables for the use of its  child  pro­
       cesses.

       SESSION_MANAGER

              This  variable  is  used  by  session-manager aware
              clients to contact gnome-session.

       DISPLAY

              This variable is set to the X display being used by
              gnome-session. Note that if the --display option is
              used this might be different from  the  setting  of
              the  environment  variable  when  gnome-session  is
              invoked.
