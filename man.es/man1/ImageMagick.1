ImageMagick(1)                                     ImageMagick(1)



NAME
       ImageMagick - ImageMagick is an X11 package for display
       and interactive manipulation of images.

DESCRIPTION
       ImageMagick, version 5.3.9, is a robust collection of
       tools and libraries to read, write, and manipulate an
       image in any of the more popular image formats including
       GIF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, and Photo CD. With ImageMagick you
       can create GIFs dynamically making it suitable for Web
       applications.  You can also resize, rotate, sharpen, color
       reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your
       completed work in the same or differing image format.
       Although the software is copyrighted, it is available for
       free and can be redistributed without fee.  ImageMagick is
       available via anonymous FTP as ftp://ftp.imagemag­
       ick.org/pub/ImageMagick/ImageMagick-5.3.9.tar.gz.


       display
              Display is a machine architecture independent image
              and display program.  It can display an image on
              any workstation display running an X server.  Dis­
              play can read and write many of the more popular
              image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Photo CD,
              etc.).  You can perform these functions on the
              image:

                   o load an image from a file
                   o display the next image
                   o display the former image
                   o display a sequence of images as a slide show
                   o write the image to a file
                   o print the image to a Postscript printer
                   o delete the image file
                   o create a Visual Image Directory
                   o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
                   o undo last image transformation
                   o copy a region of the image
                   o paste a region to the image
                   o restore the image to its original size
                   o refresh the image
                   o half the image size
                   o double the image size
                   o resize the image
                   o crop the image
                   o cut the image
                   o flop image in the horizontal direction
                   o flip image in the vertical direction
                   o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
                   o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
                   o rotate the image
                   o shear the image
                   o trim the image edges
                   o invert the colors of the image
                   o vary the color brightness
                   o vary the color saturation
                   o vary the image hue
                   o gamma correct the image
                   o sharpen the image contrast
                   o dull the image contrast
                   o perform histogram equalization on the image
                   o perform histogram normalization on the image
                   o negate the image colors
                   o toggle the colormap type: : Shared or Private
                   o reduce the speckles within an image
                   o eliminate peak noise from an image
                   o detect edges within the image
                   o emboss an image
                   o oil paint an image
                   o convert the image to grayscale
                   o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
                   o segment the image by color
                   o apply image processing techniques to a region of interest
                   o annotate the image with text
                   o draw on the image
                   o edit an image pixel color
                   o edit the image matte information
                   o composite an image with another
                   o add a border to the image
                   o surround image with an ornamental border
                   o add an image comment
                   o display image centered on a backdrop
                   o display image to background of a window
                   o display information about the image
                   o display information about this program
                   o discard all images and exit program
                   o change the level of magnification
                   o display images specified by a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform resource locator (URL)

       import Import reads an image from any visible window on an
              X server and outputs it as an image file.  You can
              capture a single window, the entire screen, or any
              rectangular portion of the screen.  You can use the
              display (see display(1)) utility for redisplay,
              printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image
              processing, etc. of the captured image.

              The target window can be specified by id, name, or
              may be selected by clicking the mouse in the
              desired window.  If you press a button and then
              drag, a rectangle will form which expands and con­
              tracts as the mouse moves.  To save the portion of
              the screen  defined by the rectangle, just release
              the button.  The keyboard bell is rung once at the
              beginning of the screen capture and twice when it
              completes.

       animate
              Animate displays a sequence of images on any work­
              station display running an X server.  Animate first
              determines the hardware capabilities of the work­
              station.  If the number of unique colors in an
              image is less than or equal to the number the work­
              station can support, the image is displayed in an X
              window.  Otherwise the number of colors in the
              image is first reduced to match the color resolu­
              tion of the workstation before it is displayed.

              This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixel
              image can display on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or
              monochrome device.  In most instances the reduced
              color image closely resembles the original.  Alter­
              natively, a monochrome or pseudo-color image
              sequence can display on a continuous-tone 24
              bits/pixels device.

       montage
              Montage creates a composite image by combining sev­
              eral separate images.  The images are tiled on the
              composite image with the name of the image option­
              ally appearing just below the individual tile.

       convert
              Convert converts an input file using one image for­
              mat to an output file with a differing image for­
              mat. By default, the image format is determined by
              its magic number. To specify a particular image
              format, precede the filename with an image format
              name and a colon (i.e.  ps:image) or specify the
              image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).
              Specify file as - for standard input or output.  If
              file has the extension .Z, the file is decoded with
              uncompress.

       mogrify
              Mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of
              images.  These transforms include image scaling,
              image rotation, color reduction, and others.  The
              transmogrified image overwrites the original image.

       identify
              describes the format and characteristics of one or
              more image files.  It will also report if an image
              is incomplete or corrupt.  The information dis­
              played includes the scene number, the file name,
              the width and height of the image, whether the
              image is colormapped or not, the number of colors
              in the image, the number of bytes in the image, the
              format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally
              the number of seconds it took to read and process
              the image.

       composite
              Combine composites images to create new images.
