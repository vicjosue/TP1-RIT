Name
       minfo - print the parameters of a MSDOS filesystem



Note of warning
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.


Description
       The minfo command prints the parameters of a Dos  filesys­
       tem,  such  as number of sectors, heads and cylinders.  It
       also prints an mformat command line which can be  used  to
       create  a  similar  Dos filesystem on another media.  How­
       ever, this doesn't work with 2m or Xdf media, and with Dos
       1.0 filesystems minfo drive:


       Mlabel supports the following option:

       v      Prints  a hexdump of the bootsector, in addition to
              the other information

Viewing the texi doc
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To  generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc,
              run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

              A    premade    html    can    be     found     at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'      and      also     at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To generate an info copy  (browsable  using  emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
