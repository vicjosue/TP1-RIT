NOMENCLATURE
       Here's a quick overview of the  naming  conventions
       used in Everybuddy.

       ACCOUNT
              An  account  has two parts.  There is a ser­
              vice and  a  handle.   The  common  way  for
              describing an account will be TOC/Zilding or
              ICQ/12345678.

       CONTACT
              A contact is the representation  of  a  real
              person, comprised of an identifying nickname
              nad a collection of accounts that the person
              has.

       HANDLE A  handle is how a person can be referred to
              while logged into a  service.   On  AIM,  an
              example  of  a  handle would be Zilding.  On
              ICQ,  an  example  of  a  handle  would   be
              12345678.

        SERVICE
              A  service  is a protocol and a server.  For
              example, the AIM service uses the TOC proto­
              col    (or    Oscar...)   and   the   server
              toc.oscar.aol.com.  The reason  the  separa­
              tion  is  made  between the protocol and the
              server  is  that  it  is  possible,  in  the
              future,  that (if there are many open proto­
              cols) there may be several separate  servers
              with  the  same protocol (or one server sup­
              porting multiple protocols) , and they  will
              be considered separate services.

ACCOUNTS
       The  first  time  you start Everybuddy, you will be
       presented with a  dialog  box.   Select  a  server,
       either AIM, ICQ, Yahoo or MSN.  Then enter your AIM
       screen name, ICQ UIN, Yahoo Username, or  MSN  User
       Name  in the Handle field and enter the password in
       the Passowrd  field.   To  add  multiple  accounts,
       click  the  Add  button.   You  must  use  existing
       accounts, because Everybuddy does not  yet  support
       creating  accounts.   You may add accounts later by
       selecting Edit Accounts from the Tools menu.

CONTACT LIST
       The Everybuddy contact list contains  Groups,  Con­
       tacts,  and  Accounts.  A Group  is a collection of
       Contacts.  A Contact is a person, who  has  one  or
       more Accounts.

       You  may  import  contact  lists  from  some  other
       instant messaging clients by selecting Import  from
       the File menu.  You can also edit your contact list
       under the Edit Contacts tab.

       To add a new contact, under the Edit Contacts  tab,
       click  on  the Add button.  In the Add Contact dia­
       log: In the Protocol  field,  select  the  service,
       AIM,  ICQ, Yahoo, or MSN, that their account is on.
       Enter their online handle  in  the  Account  field.
       Select the group you would like them to be a member
       of in the Group field.  Enter  their  name  in  the
       Contact field.  (You can create a new group or con­
       tact on the fly by typing into the Group  and  Con­
       tact   fields  instead  of  selecting  one  of  the
       options.)  By default, the Contact will be the same
       as  the Account, but it does not have to be.  Click
       on the Add button in the Add Contact dialog.

       To add an account to an existing contact, under the
       Edit  Contacts  tab, click on the Add button.  Fill
       in the  Protocol,  Account,  and  Group  fields  as
       above, and select the contact's name in the Contact
       field.  Click on the Add button in the Add  Contact
       dialog.

       To  create a new group, add a new account as above,
       and instead of selecting an existing group  in  the
       Group  field,  enter the name of the group you wish
       to create.

       To delete a group, contact, or  account,  click  on
       its  name  in  the Edit Contacts tab, then click on
       the Remove button.

       The default protocol is  the  protocol  (AIM,  ICQ,
       Yahoo  or  MSN) that Everybuddy will try first when
       communicating with a contact.  You can change  this
       by  double  clicking  on the name of the contact in
       Edit Contacts tab.

COMMUNICATION
       The Status tab shows your contact list, either  all
       of  them  or  only  the  contacts  who  are online,
       depending on the Online Only and Show All  buttons.
       Idle  and  Away  status  are  also  shown  for each
       account.

   Messages
       To send a message to a contact, double click on the
       contact  or  account under the Status tab, and type
       your message in the field at the bottom of the con­
       versation window.  Messages received from a contact
       will use the existing conversation window with  the
       contact  or  will  open  a  new  one if it does not
       exist.  If  the  Ignore  unknown  users  option  is
       selected,  messages  from an unknown person will be
       ignored.  Otherwise, such  messages  will  add  the
       unknown  person to your contact list in the Unknown
       group, and will open a conversation window with  an
       Add  button,  which you can click on to add them to
       your contact list.

   Files
       To send a file to a contact,  right  click  on  the
       contact  or  account  under  the Status tab, select
       Send File, choose a file to send in the file selec­
       tion  window,  and  click  on  OK.  Currently, file
       sending only works between two Everybuddy  clients.
       And even then, it usually requires great amounts of
       incense and several holy prayer rituals  to  ensure
       successful file transmission.

   Group Chat
       To  join  a  group chat, select Group Chat from the
       Tools menu, select the Service Type, and enter  the
       name of the chat room, then click Join.

       To  create a new chat room, do the above, and enter
       a new name in the Chat Room Name field.

       Invite users with the Invite  User  button  in  the
       chat room window that will appear.

       To leave the chat room, close its window.

PREFERENCES
       The  preferences  are accessed by selecting Prefer­
       ences from the Tools menu.

   Logs
       The Log all conversations option logs all sent  and
       received messages to ~/.everybuddy/logs/.

       AIM  messages  contain formatting and font informa­
       tion as HTML. Set Strip HTML tags to keep these out
       of the logs.

   Sound
       Set Enable sounds for sending/recieving messages to
       hear a sound every time you send or receive a  mes­
       sage.  (Gosh, imagine that.)

       Set  Enable  signon/signoff  sounds to play a sound
       every time someone in your contact list logs on  or
       off of their service.

   Chat
       Set  Send  idle/away  status to servers if you want
       the servers and other users  to  know  when  you've
       been idle.

       Set  Raise  wndow  on incomming message if you want
       the conversation window (if one exists) for a  con­
       tact  to  be  raised automatically when they send a
       message.

       Set Timestamp when a user logs on/off if  you  want
       the  conversation window (if one exists) for a con­
       tact to reflects timestamps from the  remote  party
       logging on or off of their service.

       Set  Ignore unknown users if you want to ignore all
       messages from Unknown users.  Note that if you  set
       this  option,  the  Unknown group will be hidden as
       well.

       Set Enable multi-line chat for a  multi-line  input
       window.

       When  Press  enter to send is not set, messages are
       sent with Enter, and newlines are typed with Shift-
       Enter.   When  it  is  set,  messages are sent with
       Ctrl-Enter and newlines are typed with Enter.  This
       option  only  affects  multi-line chat.  Set Times­
       tamps on Messages to show timestamps  for  messages
       in the conversation window.

   Connections
       This  section  allows you to set the servers to use
       for each service.  You  probably  do  not  have  to
       change these.

   Proxy
       If you aren't behind a firewall, set Direct Connec­
       tion.  Otherwise, set either Use HTTP Proxy or  Use
       SOCKS5  Proxy  and enter the Proxy Server and Proxy
       Port.  If you are unsure  of  these  settings,  ask
       your  system administrator.  Note: Not all services
       are available through proxy, please see the  README
       for details.

BUGS
       Everybuddy  is in very early stages of development,
       so it is not completely stable and some features of
       the underlying services are not yet supported.

BUG REPORTS
       If  you find a bug in Everybuddy, please send elec­
       tronic   mail   to   everybuddy@valhalla.marko.net.

       you used to compile it.

       Before sending a bug report, please verify that you
       have the latest version of Everybuddy.   Many  bugs
       (major and minor) are fixed at each release, and if
       yours is out of date, the problem may already  have
       been solved.

       Bug  reports that include diffs to correct them get
       higher priority than those that do not.
