import  -  capture some or all of an X server screen and save the
image to a file.

import [ options ... ] file

Import reads an image from any visible window on an X server  and
outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the
entire screen, or any rectangular portion  of  the  screen.   Use
display  for redisplay, printing, editing, formatting, archiving,
image processing, etc. of the captured image.

The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be select­
ed  by  clicking  the mouse in the desired window. If you press a
button and then drag, a rectangle will  form  which  expands  and
contracts  as  the mouse moves. To save the portion of the screen
defined by the rectangle, just release the button.  The  keyboard
bell  is  rung  once  at  the beginning of the screen capture and
twice when it completes.

To select an X window with the mouse and save it in the MIFF  im­
age format to a file titled window.miff, use:

    import window.miff

To  select an X window and save it in the Encapsulated Postscript
format to include in another document, use:

    import figure.eps

To capture the entire X server screen in the JPEG image format in
a file titled root.jpeg, use:

    import -window root root.jpeg

Options are processed in command line order. Any option you spec­
ify on the command line remains in effect until it is  explicitly
changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.

Import  options  can  appear on the command line or in your X re­
sources file. See X(1). Options on  the  command  line  supersede
values  specified  in  your X resources file.  surround the image
with a border of color

See X(1) for details about the geometry specification.

the border color megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

Image  pixels  are  stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory
have been consumed. Subsequent pixel  operations  are  cached  on
disk.  Operations  to memory are significantly faster but if your
computer does not have a sufficient amount of free memory you may
want to adjust this threshold value.

preferred number of colors in the image

The  actual  number  of colors in the image may be less than your
request, but never more. Note, this is a color reduction  option.
Images  with  less  unique colors than specified with this option
will have any duplicate or unused colors removed. Refer to  quan­
tize for more details.


Note,  options  -dither,  -colorspace,  and -treedepth affect the
color reduction algorithm.

the type of colorspace

Choices are: GRAY,  OHTA,  RGB,  Transparent,  XYZ,  YCbCr,  YIQ,
YPbPr, YUV, or CMYK.


Color  reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space.
Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color  spaces  such
as  YUV  or  YIQ  correspond to perceptual color differences more
closely than do distances in RGB space.  These color  spaces  may
give better results when color reducing an image.  Refer to quan­
tize for more details.


The Transparent color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.


The  -colors or -monochrome option is required for this option to
take effect.

annotate an image with a comment

Use this option to assign a specific comment to  the  image.  You
can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other im­
age attribute by embedding special format characters:


     %b   file size
     %c   comment
     %d   directory
     %e   filename extention
     %f   filename
     %h   height
     %i   input filename
     %k   number of unique colors
     %l   label
     %m   magick
     %n   number of scenes
     %o   output filename
     %p   page number
     %q   quantum depth
     %s   scene number
     %t   top of filename
     %u   unique temporary filename
     %w   width
     %x   x resolution
     %y   y resolution
     \n   newline
     \r   carriage return

For example,


     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image comment of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an  image
titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If  the first character of string is @, the image comment is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

preferred size and location of the cropped image

See X(1) for details about the geometry specification.


The width and height give the size of the image that remains  af­
ter  cropping,  and the offsets give the location of the top left
corner of the cropped image with respect to the  original  image.
To specify the amount to be removed, use -shave instead.


To  specify  a  percentage width or height to be removed instead,
append %. For example to crop the image by ten percent (five per­
cent on each side of the image), use -crop 10%.


Use  cropping to apply image processing options to, or display, a
particular area of an image.


Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more  subimages  of  a
uniform size.


Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image. Use -crop 0x0
to trim edges that are the background color. Add an x and y  off­
set to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.

enable debug printout display the next image after pausing

This  option is useful for regulating the animation of GIF images
within Netscape. Delay/100 seconds must expire before the display
of  the  next image. The default is no delay between each showing
of the image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.


You can specify a delay range (e.g. -delay 10-500) which sets the
minimum and maximum delay.

vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image

This option specifies an image density when decoding a PostScript
or Portable Document page. The default is 72 dots per inch in the
horizontal and vertical direction. This option is used in concert
with -page.

depth of the image

This is the number of bits in a pixel. The only acceptable values
are  8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of raw images
whose depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or  to  change
the depth of any image after it has been read.

obtain  image  by descending window hierarchy reduce the speckles
within an image specifies the X server to  contact  GIF  disposal
method

Here are the valid methods:


     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose between frames.
     2     Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3      Overwrite with previous frame.  apply Floyd/Steinberg
error diffusion to the image

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity  resolution
for  spatial  resolution  by averaging the intensities of several
neighboring pixels.  Images which suffer from  severe  contouring
when reducing colors can be improved with this option.


The  -colors or -monochrome option is required for this option to
take effect.


Use +dither to render Postscript without text or  graphic  alias­
ing.

<width>x<height>+<outer  bevel  width>+<inner  bevel width>" sur­
round the image with an ornamental border

See X(1) for details about the geometry specification.


The color of the border is specified with the -mattecolor command
line option.

preferred size and location of the Image window.

See  X(1)  for  details  about the geometry specification. By de­
fault, the window size is the image size and the location is cho­
sen by you when it is mapped.


By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the
image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value
while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image. Append an excla­
mation point to the geometry to force the image size  to  exactly
the  size  you  specify. For example, if you specify 640x480! the
image width is set to 640 pixels and height to 480. If  only  one
factor  is specified, both the width and height assume the value.


To specify a percentage width or height instead,  append  %.  The
image  size  is multiplied by the width and height percentages to
obtain the final image dimensions. To increase the size of an im­
age, use a value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an im­
age's size, use a percentage less than 100.


Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.


Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if its size  ex­
ceeds the geometry specification. < resizes the image only if its
dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For  example,
if  you specify '640x480>' and the image size is 512x512, the im­
age size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024,  it
is resized to 640x480.


Use  < to change the dimensions of the image only if its size ex­
ceeds the geometry specification. > resizes the image only if its
dimensions  is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify 640x480> and the image size is 512x512, the  image
size  does  not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is
resized to 640x480.


There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript coordinates.

print usage instructions the type of interlacing scheme

Choices are: None, Line, Plane,  or  Partition.  The  default  is
None.


This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for
raw image formats such as RGB or YUV. None means do not interlace
(RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...),    Line    uses   scanline   interlacing
(RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and Plane uses plane  in­
terlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).  Partition is like plane
except the different planes are saved to individual  files  (e.g.
image.R, image.G, and image.B).


Use  Line,  or  Plane to create an interlaced PNG or  GIF or pro­
gressive JPEG image.

assign a label to an image

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image.  Option­
ally  you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or
other image attribute by embedding special format character.  See
-comment for details.


For example,


     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces  an  image  label of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image
titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If the first character of string is @, the image  label  is  read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.


When converting to PostScript, use this option to specify a head­
er string to print above the image. Specify the label  font  with
-font.

transform  the  image to black and white replace every pixel with
its complementary color

The red, green, and blue intensities of  an  image  are  negated.
White  becomes  black,  yellow becomes blue, etc.  Use +negate to
only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.

size and location of an image canvas

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the PostScript  page
in  dots  per  inch  or  a TEXT page in pixels. The choices for a
Postscript page are:


     11x17         792  1224

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g.  A4,
Ledger, etc.). Otherwise, -page behaves much like -geometry (e.g.
-page letter+43+43>).


To position a GIF image, use  -page{+-}<x  offset>{+-}<y  offset>
(e.g. -page +100+200).


For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in -geometry and po­
sitioned relative to the lower left hand corner of  the  page  by
{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<y  offset>. Use -page 612x792>, for example, to
center the image within the page. If the image size  exceeds  the
Postscript page, it is reduced to fit the page.


The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.


This option is used in concert with -density.

efficiently  determine  image  characteristics  pointsize  of the
Postscript, OPTION1, or TrueType font  JPEG/MIFF/PNG  compression
level

For  the  JPEG  image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).
The default quality is 75.


Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of  im­
age  compression  (quality  / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10).
Compression quality values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). If
filter-type  is  4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for
all scanlines:


     0: none
     1: sub
     2: up
     3: average
     4: Paeth

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when  quality  is
greater  than  50 and the image does not have a color map, other­
wise no filtering is used.


If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with minimum-sum-
of-absolute-values is used.


The  default  is  quality is 75. Which means nearly the best com­
pression with adaptive filtering.


For further information, see the PNG specification.

apply Paeth image rotation to the image

Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds  the  height.
<  rotates  the  image only if its width is less than the height.
For example, if you specify -90> and the image size  is  480x640,
the  image is not rotated by the specified angle. However, if the
image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.


Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with
the color defined as background (class backgroundColor). See X(1)
for details.

number of screen snapshots

Use this option to grab more than one image  from  the  X  server
screen  to  create  an animation sequence.  specify the screen to
capture

This option indicates that the GetImage request  used  to  obtain
the image should be done on the root window, rather than directly
on the specified window.  In this way, you can obtain  pieces  of
other  windows that overlap the specified window, and more impor­
tantly, you can capture menus or other popups that  are  indepen­
dent  windows but appear over the specified window.  select some­
thing in import operate silently width and height of the image

Use this option to specify the width and  height  of  raw  images
whose dimensions are unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK. In addi­
tion to width and height, use -size with an offset  to  skip  any
header information in the image or tell the number of colors in a
MAP image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

     192x128
     384x256
     768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution  layer
of a JBIG or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).

make  this  color transparent within the image print detailed in­
formation about the image

This information is printed: image scene number; image name;  im­
age size; the image class (DirectClass or PseudoClass); the total
number of unique colors; and the number of seconds  to  read  and
transform  the image.  Refer to miff for a description of the im­
age class.


If -colors is also specified, the total unique colors in the  im­
age  and color reduction error values are printed. Refer to quan­
tize for a description of these values.
