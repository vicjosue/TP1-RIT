APM(1)              Linux Programmer's Manual              APM(1)



NAME
       apm - query Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS

SYNOPSIS
       apm [ -vVmsS ]

DESCRIPTION
       apm  reads  /proc/apm  and presents the output in a human-
       readable format.  Since primarily battery status  informa­
       tion  is  provided, this command is most useful on laptops
       with a compliant APM BIOS.  apm also allows the machine to
       be put into standby or suspend mode.

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              Print the apm program version and exit immediately.

       -v, --verbose
              Print information about the APM  BIOS  version  and
              Linux APM driver version.

       -m, --minutes
              Print  total  minutes remaining instead of using an
              hh:mm format.

       -s, --suspend
              Put the machine into suspend mode if possible.

       -S, --standby
              Put the machine into standby mode if possible.


       BUGS   This program requires a post-1.3.57  kernel.   This
              program  will  not  work with older kernels or with
              the APM patches, since the format for /proc/apm has
              changed radically.
