PSTREE(1)                 User Commands                 PSTREE(1)



NAME
       pstree - display a tree of processes

SYNOPSIS
       pstree [-a] [-c] [-h|-Hpid] [-l] [-n] [-p] [-u] [-G|-U]
       [pid|user]
       pstree -V

DESCRIPTION
       pstree shows running processes as  a  tree.  The  tree  is
       rooted  at either pid or init if pid is omitted. If a user
       name is specified, all process trees rooted  at  processes
       owned by that user are shown.

       pstree  visually merges identical branches by putting them
       in square brackets and prefixing them with the  repetition
       count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]


OPTIONS
       -a     Show command line arguments. If the command line of
              a process is swapped out, that process is shown  in
              parentheses. -a implicitly disables compaction.

       -c     Disable   compaction   of  identical  subtrees.  By
              default, subtrees are compacted whenever  possible.

       -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       -h     Highlight  the  current  process and its ancestors.
              This is a no-op if  the  terminal  doesn't  support
              highlighting  or if neither the current process nor
              any of its  ancestors  are  in  the  subtree  being
              shown.

       -H     Like   -h,  but  highlight  the  specified  process
              instead. Unlike with -h, pstree fails when using -H
              if highlighting is not available.

       -l     Display long lines. By default, lines are truncated
              to the display width or 132 if output is sent to  a
              non-tty or if the display width is unknown.

       -n     Sort  processes  with  the  same  ancestor  by  PID
              instead of by name. (Numeric sort.)

       -p     Show PIDs. PIDs are shown  as  decimal  numbers  in
              parentheses  after each process name. -p implicitly
              disables compaction.

       -u     Show uid transitions. Whenever the uid of a process
              differs  from the uid of its parent, the new uid is
              shown in parentheses after the process name.

       -U     Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under
              Linux  1.1-54  and  above, UTF-8 mode is entered on
              the console with echo -e  '\033%8'  and  left  with
              echo -e '\033%@'

       -V     Display version information.

FILES
