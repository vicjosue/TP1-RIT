GNOME(1)                                                 GNOME(1)



save-session - Saves the current GNOME session (or terminates it)

SYNOPSIS
       save-session [--kill] [--gui]

DESCRIPTION
       save-session can be used from a GNOME session  to  save  a
       snapshot of the currently running applications.  This ses­
       sion will be later restored at  your  next  GNOME  startup
       session.

       You can specify the --kill argument to terminate the GNOME
       session.

       The --gui argument will show a dialog when the session  is
       saved, and report errors in dialog boxes instead of print­
       ing to stderr.
