NAME
       saned - SANE network daemon

SYNOPSIS
       saned [-d|-s [n]]

DESCRIPTION
       saned  is  the  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon that
       allows remote clients to access image acquisition  devices
       available on the local host.

OPTIONS
       The  -d  and -s flags request that saned run in debug mode
       (as opposed  to  inetd(8)  mode).   In  this  mode,  saned
       explicitly  waits for a connection request.  When compiled
       with debugging enabled, these flags may be followed  by  a
       number  to  request debug info. The larger the number, the
       more verbose the debug output.  E.g., -d128  will  request
       printing  of  all debug info. Debug level 0 means no debug
       output at all. The default value is 2. If flag -d is used,
       the  debug  messages  will  be  printed to stderr while -s
       requests using syslog.

CONFIGURATION
       First and foremost: please do not install saned as  setuid
       root  without  due  consideration.   Especially when using
       dynamic linking, there  is  a  potential  for  introducing
       security holes when running this program as root.

       The  contents  of  the  saned.conf  file is a list of host
       names or IP addresses that are permitted to use local SANE
       devices.  Connections from localhost are always permitted.
       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored.   A line containing the single character ``+'' is
       interpreted to match any hostname.  This allows any remote
       machine  to  use  your  scanner and may present a security
       risk, so this shouldn't  be  used  unless  you  know  what
       you're doing.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              scan-client.somedomain.firm
              # this is a comment
              192.168.0.1

       The case of the host names does not matter,  so  AHost.COM
       is considered identical to ahost.com.

       For  saned to work properly, it is also necessary to add a
       configuration line to /etc/inetd.conf.  The  configuration
       line normally looks like this:

              sane  stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/saned
              saned

       However, if your system uses tcpd(8) for additional  secu­
       rity  screening, you may want to disable saned access con­
       trol by putting ``+'' in saned.conf and use a line of  the
       following form in /etc/inetd.conf instead:

              sane  stream  tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/tcpd
              saned

       Note that both examples assume that there is a saned group
       and a saned user.  If you follow this example, please make
       sure that the access permissions on the special device are
       set  such  that  saned can access the scanner (the program
       generally needs read and write access to scanner devices).

       If xinetd is installed on your system instead of inetd the
       following example for xinetd.conf may be helpful:

              # default: off
              # description: The sane server accepts requests
              # for network access to a local scanner via the
              # network.
              service sane
              {
                 port        = 6566
                 socket_type = stream
                 wait        = no
                 user        = saned
                 group       = saned
                 server      = /usr/local/sbin/saned
              }

       Finally, it is also necessary to add a line of the follow­
       ing form to /etc/services:

              sane 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon

       Note  that  port  number  6566  has  not  been  officially
       assigned to the SANE network protocol and may thus  change
       in the future.



RESTRICTIONS
       In  addition  to  the control connection (port 6566) saned
       also uses a data connection. The port of  this  socket  is
       selected by the operating system and can't be specified by
       the user currently. This may be a problem if  the  connec­
       tion must go through a firewall (packet filter).


FILES
       /etc/hosts.equiv
              The  hosts  listed  in  this  file are permitted to
              access all local SANE devices.  Caveat:  this  file
              imposes  serious  security risks and its use is not
              recommended.

       /etc/sane.d/saned.conf
              Contains a list of hosts permitted to access  local
              SANE  devices  (see  also  description of SANE_CON­
              FIG_DIR below).

       /etc/sane.d/saned.users
              If this file contains lines of the form

              user:password:backend

              access to the  listed  backends  is  restricted.  A
              backend  may be listed multiple times for different
              user/password combinations.  The  server  uses  MD5
              encryption if supported by the client.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of
              directories  that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  Under UNIX, the directories are separated by
              a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by  a
              semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default
              directories:  first,  the current working directory
              (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
              environment  variable ends with the directory sepa­
              rator character, then the default  directories  are
              searched  after  the  explicitly specified directo­
              ries.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
              "/tmp/config:"    would   result   in   directories
              "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched
              (in this order).
