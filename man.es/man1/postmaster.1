DESCRIPTION
       postmaster  is  the  PostgreSQL multiuser database server.
       In order for a client application to access a database  it
       connects (over a network or locally) to a running postmas­
       ter. The postmaster then starts a separate server  process
       (``postgres(1)'') to handle the connection. The postmaster
       also manages the communication among server processes.

       By default the postmaster starts  in  the  foreground  and
       prints  log  messages to the standard output. In practical
       applications the postmaster should be started as  a  back­
       ground process, perhaps at boot time.

       One  postmaster  always  manages the data from exactly one
       database cluster. A database cluster is  a  collection  of
       databases that is stored at a common file system location.
       When the postmaster starts it needs to know  the  location
       of  the  database  cluster  files (``data area''). This is
       done with the -D invocation option or the PGDATA  environ­
       ment  variable;  there is no default.  More than one post­
       master process can run on a system at one time, as long as
       they  use different data areas and different communication
       ports (see below). A data area is created with  initdb(1).

   OPTIONS
       postmaster  accepts  the following command line arguments.
       For a detailed  discussion  of  the  options  consult  the
       Administrator's  Guide.  You  can also save typing most of
       these options by setting up a configuration file.

       -A 0|1 Enables run-time assert checks, which is  a  debug­
              ging  aid  to  detect programming mistakes. This is
              only available if it was  enabled  during  compila­
              tion. If so, the default is on.

       -B nbuffers
              Sets  the  number  of shared buffers for use by the
              server  processes.  This  value  defaults   to   64
              buffers, where each buffer is 8 kB.

       -c name=value
              Sets a named run-time parameter. Consult the Admin­
              istrator's Guide for a list and descriptions.  Most
              of the other command line options are in fact short
              forms of such a parameter assignment. -c can appear
              multiple times to set multiple parameters.

       -d debug-level
              Sets the debug level. The higher this value is set,
              the more debugging output is written to the  server
              log.  The  default  is 0, which means no debugging.
              Values up to 4 are useful; higher  numbers  produce
              no additional output.

       -D datadir
              Specifies  the  file  system  location  of the data
              directory. See discussion above.

       -F     Disables fsync calls for  performance  improvement,
              at the risk of data corruption in event of a system
              crash. Read the detailed documentation before using
              this!

       -h hostname
              Specifies  the TCP/IP host name or address on which
              the postmaster is to listen  for  connections  from
              client  applications.  Defaults to listening on all
              configured addresses (including localhost).

       -i     Allows clients  to  connect  via  TCP/IP  (Internet
              domain)  connections.  Without  this  option,  only
              local Unix domain socket connections are  accepted.

       -k directory
              Specifies  the  directory of the Unix-domain socket
              on which the postmaster is to  listen  for  connec­
              tions from client applications. The default is nor­
              mally /tmp, but can be changed at build time.

       -l     Enables secure connections using SSL. The -i option
              is  also  required. You must have compiled with SSL
              enabled to use this option.

       -N max-connections
              Sets the maximum number of client connections  that
              this postmaster will accept. By default, this value
              is 32, but it can be set as  high  as  your  system
              will  support.  (Note  that -B is required to be at
              least twice -N. See the Administrator's Guide for a
              discussion  of  system  resource  requirements  for
              large numbers of client connections.)

       -o extra-options
              The command line-style options specified in  extra-
              options  are passed to all backend server processes
              started by this  postmaster.  See  postgres(1)  for
              possibilities.  If  the  option string contains any
              spaces, the entire string must be quoted.

       -p port
              Specifies the TCP/IP  port  or  local  Unix  domain
              socket file extension on which the postmaster is to
              listen for connections  from  client  applications.
              Defaults  to  the  value  of the PGPORT environment
              variable, or if PGPORT is not set, then defaults to
              the  value established during compilation (normally
              5432). If you specify a port other than the default
              port, then all client applications must specify the
              same port  using  either  command-line  options  or
              PGPORT.

       -S     Specifies  that the postmaster process should start
              up in silent mode. That is,  it  will  disassociate
              from  the  user's (controlling) terminal, start its
              own process group, and redirect its standard output
              and standard error to /dev/null.

              Using  this  switch  discards  all  logging output,
              which is probably not what you want, since it makes
              it  very  difficult  to  troubleshoot problems. See
              below for a better way to start the  postmaster  in
              the background.

       --name=value
              Sets  a named run-time parameter; a shorter form of
              -c.


       Two additional command  line  options  are  available  for
       debugging problems that cause a backend to die abnormally.
       These options control the behavior of  the  postmaster  in
       this  situation, and neither option is intended for use in
       ordinary operation.

       The ordinary strategy for this situation is to notify  all
       other  backends  that  they must terminate and then reini­
       tialize the shared memory and semaphores. This is  because
       an  errant  backend could have corrupted some shared state
       before terminating.

       These special-case options are:

       -n     postmaster will not reinitialize shared data struc­
              tures.  A  knowledgeable system programmer can then
              use  a  debugger  to  examine  shared  memory   and
              semaphore state.

       -s     postmaster will stop all other backend processes by
              sending the signal SIGSTOP, but will not cause them
              to  terminate.  This  permits system programmers to
              collect core dumps from all  backend  processes  by
              hand.


   OUTPUTS
       semget: No space left on device
              If  you  see  this message, you should run the ipc­
              clean command. After doing so, try  starting  post­
              master again. If this still doesn't work, you prob­
              ably need to configure your kernel for shared  mem­
              ory and semaphores as described in the installation
              notes. If you run multiple instances of  postmaster
              on  a  single  host, or have a kernel with particu­
              larly small shared memory and/or semaphore  limits,
              you may have to reconfigure your kernel to increase
              its shared memory or semaphore parameters.

              Tip: You may be able to postpone reconfiguring your
              kernel by decreasing -B to reduce the shared memory
              consumption of PostgreSQL, and/or by reducing -N to
              reduce the semaphore consumption.


       StreamServerPort: cannot bind to port
              If  you  see  this message, you should make certain
              that there is no other postmaster  process  already
              running on the same port number. The easiest way to
              determine this is by using the command

              $ ps ax | grep postmaster

              or

              $ ps -e | grep postmaster

              depending on your system.

              If you are sure that no other postmaster  processes
              are running and you still get this error, try spec­
              ifying a different port using the  -p  option.  You
              may  also get this error if you terminate the post­
              master and immediately restart it  using  the  same
              port; in this case, you must simply wait a few sec­
              onds until the operating  system  closes  the  port
              before  trying  again.  Finally,  you  may get this
              error if you specify a port number that your  oper­
              ating  system  considers to be reserved.  For exam­
              ple, many versions of Unix  consider  port  numbers
              under  1024  to be trusted and only permit the Unix
              superuser to access them.


NOTES
       If at all possible, do not use SIGKILL to kill  the  post­
       master. This will prevent postmaster from freeing the sys­
       tem resources (e.g., shared memory and semaphores) that it
       holds before terminating.

       To terminate the postmaster normally, the signals SIGTERM,
       SIGINT, or SIGQUIT can be used. The first  will  wait  for
       all  clients to terminate before quitting, the second will
       forcefully disconnect all clients, and the third will quit
       immediately without proper shutdown, resulting in a recov­
       ery run during restart.

       The utility command pg_ctl(1) can be  used  to  start  and
       shut down the postmaster safely and comfortably.

       The  --  options will not work on FreeBSD or OpenBSD.  Use
       -c instead. This is a bug in the affected  operating  sys­
       tems;  a  future  release  of  PostgreSQL  will  provide a
       workaround if this is not fixed.

USAGE
       To start postmaster in the background using  default  val­
       ues, type:

       $ nohup postmaster >logfile 2>&1 </dev/null &


       To start postmaster with a specific port:

       $ postmaster -p 1234

       This   command  will  start  up  postmaster  communicating
       through the port 1234. In order to connect to  this  post­
       master using psql, you would need to run it as

       $ psql -p 1234

       or set the environment variable PGPORT:

       $ export PGPORT=1234
       $ psql


       Named  runtime  parameters  can  be set in either of these
       styles:

       $ postmaster -c sort_mem=1234
       $ postmaster --sort-mem=1234

       Either form overrides whatever  setting  might  exist  for
       sort_mem  in  postgresql.conf.  Notice that underscores in
       parameter names can be written  as  either  underscore  or
       dash on the command line.

              Tip: Except for short-term experiments, it's proba­
              bly better practice to edit the  setting  in  post­
              gresql.conf  than  to rely on a command-line switch
              to set a parameter.
