TREE(1)                                                   TREE(1)



NAME
       tree - list contents of directories in a tree-like format.

SYNOPSIS
       tree [ -adfgilnopqstuxACDFNS ] [ -L level [  -R  ]]  [  -H
       baseHREF ] [ -P pattern ] [ -I pattern ] [ directory ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tree is a recursive directory listing  program  that  pro­
       duces  a  depth  indented  listing of files, which is col­
       orized ala dircolors if the LS_COLORS environment variable
       is  set  and  output  is  to tty.  With no arguments, tree
       lists the files in the current directory.  When  directory
       arguments  are  given,  tree  lists  all  the files and/or
       directories found in the given directories each  in  turn.
       Upon  completion  of  listing all files/directories found,
       tree returns the total number of files and/or  directories
       listed.

       By  default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path
       that the symbolic link refers to is printed after the name
       of the link in the format:

           name -> real-path

       If  the  `-l' option is given and the symbolic link refers
       to an actual directory, then tree will follow the path  of
       the symbolic link as if it were a real directory.


OPTIONS
       Tree understands the following command line switches:


       --help Outputs a verbose usage listing.


       --version
              Outputs the version of tree.


       -a     All  files  are  printed.  By default tree does not
              print hidden files  (those  beginning  with  a  dot
              `.').   In no event does tree print the file system
              constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previ­
              ous directory).


       -d     List directories only.


       -f     Prints the full path prefix for each file.


       -i     Makes  tree not print the indentation lines, useful
              when used in conjunction with the -f option.


       -l     Follows symbolic links if they  point  to  directo­
              ries,  as  if they were directories. Symbolic links
              that will result  in  recursion  are  avoided  when
              detected.


       -x     Stay  on  the  current  file-system only.  Ala find
              -xdev.


       -P pattern
              List only those files that match the wild-card pat­
              tern.   Note:  you  must  use the -a option to also
              consider those files beginning with a dot  `.'  for
              matching.   Valid  wildcard  operators are `*' (any
              zero or more characters), `?' (any  single  charac­
              ter),  `[...]' (any single character listed between
              brackets (optional - (dash) for character range may
              be used: ex: [A-Z]), and `[^...]' (any single char­
              acter not listed in brackets).


       -I pattern
              Do not list those files that  match  the  wild-card
              pattern.


       -p     Print the protections for each file (as per ls -l).


       -o filename
              Send output to filename.


       -s     Print the size of each file along with the name.


       -u     Print the username, or UID  #  if  no  username  is
              available, of the file.


       -g     Print  the group name, or GID # if no group name is
              available, of the file.


       -D     Print the date of the last  modification  time  for
              the file listed.


       -F     Append  a  `/'  for  directories,  a `=' for socket
              files, a `*' for executable files  and  a  `|'  for
              FIFO's, as per ls -F


       -q     Print  non-printable  characters  in  filenames  as
              question marks instead of the default carrot  nota­
              tion.


       -N     Print non-printable characters as is instead of the
              default carrot notation.


       -t     Sort the output by last modification  time  instead
              of alphabetically.


       -n     Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the -C
              option.


       -C     Turn colorization on always, using  built-in  color
              defaults  if  the LS_COLORS environment variable is
              not set.  Useful to colorize output to a pipe.


       -A     Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when  printing  the
              indentation lines.


       -S     Turn  on  ASCII  line  graphics  (useful when using
              linux console mode fonts).


       -L level
              Max display depth of the directory tree.


       -R     Recursively cross down the tree each level directo­
              ries  (see  -L option), and at each of them execute
              tree again adding `-o 00Tree.html' as a new option.


       -H baseHREF
              Turn  on  HTML  output,  including HTTP references.
              Useful for ftp sites.  baseHREF gives the base  ftp
              location when using HTML output. That is, the local
              directory may be `/local/ftp/pub', but it  must  be
              referenced       as       `ftp://hostname.organiza­
              tion.domain/pub' (baseHREF should  be  `ftp://host­
              name.organization.domain/').  Hint:  don't use col­
              orization and/or ANSI lines with this  option,  and
              don't give more than one directory in the directory
              list.


FILES
       /etc/DIR_COLORS          System color database.
       ~/.dircolors             Users color database.


ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS      Color information created by dircolors

BUGS
       None  known.   Not  heavily  tested.  Could use a few more
       options, ala ls.
