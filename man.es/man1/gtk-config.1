NAME
       gtk-config - script to get information about the installed
       version of GTK+

SYNOPSIS
       gtk-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]]  [--ver­
       sion] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       gtk-config  is  a tool that is used to configure to deter­
       mine the compiler and linker flags that should be used  to
       compile  and  link programs that use GTK+. It is also used
       internally to the .m4 macros for  GNU  autoconf  that  are
       included with GTK+.

OPTIONS
       gtk-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print  the  currently installed version of GTK+ on
               the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to  link
               a GTK+ program.

       --cflags
               Print  the  compiler  flags  that are necessary to
               compile a GTK+ program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the  installa­
               tion  prefix that GTK+ was built with when comput­
               ing  the  output  for  the  --cflags  and   --libs
               options.  This  option  is  also used for the exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was  not  specified.  This
               option  must  be  specified  before  any --libs or
               --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the  installa­
               tion  exec  prefix  that  GTK+ was built with when
               computing the output for the --cflags  and  --libs
               options.  This option must be specified before any
               --libs or --cflags options.
