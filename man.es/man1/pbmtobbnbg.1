NAME
       pbmtobg - convert a portable bitmap into BitGraph graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtobg [rasterop] [x y] < pbmfile

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Produces  BBN  BitGraph
       terminal Display Pixel Data (DPD) sequence as output.

       The  rasterop  can  be  specified on the command line.  If
       this is omitted, 3 (replace) will be used.  A position  in
       (x,y)  coordinates  can  also  be  specified.  If both are
       given, the rasterop comes first.  The portable  bitmap  is
       always taken from the standard input.
