       Perl 5 README file for the EPOC operating system.

       EPOC is a OS for palmtops and mobile phones. For more
       informations look at: http://www.symbian.com/

       This is a port of perl to EPOC. It runs on ER5 machines:
       Psion 5mx, 5mx Pro, Psion Revo and on the Ericson M128. I
       have no report about the Psion Netbook or the S7. It runs
       on ER3 Hardware (Series 5 classic), too. For more informa­
       tion about this hardware please refer to
       http://www.psion.com.

       Vendors which like to have support for their devices are
       free to send me a sample.

       You can download a ready-to-install version from
       http://www.science-computing.de/o.flebbe/perl. You may
       find other versions with some CPAN modules included at
       this location.

       You will need at least 4MB free space in order to install
       and run perl.

       Install perl.sis on the EPOC machine. If you do not know
       how to do that, consult your PsiWin documentation.

       Perl itself and its standard library is using 2.9 MB disk
       space.  Unicode support and some other modules are left
       out. (For details, please look into epoc/createpkg.pl). If
       you like to use these modules, you are free to copy them
       from a current perl release.

       For ER5 machines, you can get the software Perlstart
       http://www.science-computing.de/o.flebbe/perl. It contains
       file recognizers for files with the extension .pl and .pm.
       With it you can start perl with a double click on the
       camel icon. Be sure to configure the perl installation
       drive first. You can even provide a script with a special
       commandline, if needed.

       Alternativly you can get ESHELL from symbian:
       http://developer.epocworld.com/downloads/progs/Eshell.zip

       Running ESHELL you can enter: perl -de 0 in order to run
       the perl debugger. If you are leaving perl, you get into
       the system screen. You have to switch back manually to
       ESHELL. When perl is running, you will see a task with the
       name STDOUT in the task list.

       If you have a ER3 machine (i.e. a PSION 5), you may have
       to supply the full path to the perl executable C:\sys­
       tem\programs\perl.exe.

       If you need to set the current directory of perl, please
       use the command line switch '-x'. See the perlrun manpage
       for details.

       You can stop a running perl process in the task list by
       closing the application `STDOUT'. You cannot stop a run­
       ning perl process if it has not written anyting to stdout
       or stderr! Be very cautious with I/O redirection. You will
       have to reboot the PDA!

       You can redirect the output with the UNIX bourne shell
       syntax (this is built into perl rather then eshell) For
       instance the following command line will run the script
       test.pl with the output redirected to stdout_file, the
       errors to stderr_file and input from stdin_file.

       perl test.pl >stdout_file <stdin_file 2>stderr_file

       Alternatively you can use 2>&1 in order to add the stan­
       dard error output to stdout.

       ESHELL looks for executables in ?:/System/Programs. The
       SIS file installs perl in this special folder directory.
       The default drive and path are the same as folder the exe­
       cutable resides. The EPOC filesystem is case-preserving,
       not case-sensitive.

       The EPOC estdlib uses the ?: syntax for establishing a
       search order: First in C: (RAM), then on D: (CF Card, if
       present) and last in Z: (ROM). For instance ?:\a.txt
       searches for C:\a.txt, D:\a.txt (and Z:\a.txt)

       The perl @INC search path is implemented with '?:'. Your
       perl executable can live on a different drive than the
       perl library or even your scripts.

       ESHELL paths have to be written with backslashes '\', file
       arguments to perl with slashes '/'. Remember that I/O
       redirection is done internally in perl, so please use
       slashes for redirects.

       perl.exe C:/test.pl >C:/output.txt

       A suitable text editor can be downloaded from symbian
        http://developer.epocworld.com/downloads/progs/Editor.zip

       The built-in function EPOC::getcwd returns the current
       directory.

       Features are left out, because of restrictions of the
       POSIX support in EPOC:

       ·   backquoting, pipes etc.

       ·   system() does not inherit ressources like: file
           descriptors, environment etc.

       ·   signal, kill, alarm. Do not try to use them. This may
           be impossible to implement on EPOC.

       ·   select is missing.

       ·   binmode does not exist. (No CR LF to LF translation
           for text files)

       ·   EPOC does not handle the notion of current drive and
           current directory very well (i.e. not at all, but it
           tries hard to emulate one) See PATH.

       ·   Heap is limited to 4MB.

       ·   Dynamic loading is not implemented.

       Sorry, this is far too short.

       ·   You will need the C++ SDK from http://developer.epoc­
           world.com/.

       ·   You will need to set up the cross SDK from
           http://www.science-computing.de/o.flebbe/sdk

       ·   You may have to adjust config.sh (cc, cppflags) to
           reflect your epoc and SDK location.

       ·   Get the Perl sources from your nearest CPAN site.

       ·   Unpack the sources.

       ·   Build a native perl from this sources... Make sure to
           save the miniperl executable as miniperl.native.

           Start again from scratch

                 cp epoc/* .
                 ./Configure -S
                 make
                 cp miniperl.native miniperl
                 make
