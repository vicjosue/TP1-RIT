NAME
       pnmtofits - convert a portable anymap into FITS format

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtofits [-max f] [-min f] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Produces a FITS (Flexi­
       ble Image Transport System) file as output.   The  resolu­
       tion  of  the  output  file  is either 8 bits/pixel, or 16
       bits/pixel, depending on the value of maxval in the  input
       file.   If  the  input  file  is  a  portable  bitmap or a
       portable graymap, the output file  consists  of  a  single
       plane  image  (NAXIS  = 2). If instead the input file is a
       portable pixmap, the output file will consist of a  three-
       plane  image  (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).  A full description
       of the FITS format can be  found  in  Astronomy  &  Astro­
       physics Supplement Series 44 (1981), page 363.

OPTIONS
       Flags  -min  and -max can be used to set DATAMAX, DATAMIN,
       BSCALE and BZERO in the FITS header, but do not cause  the
       data to be rescaled.
