DESCRIPTION
       fmirror is a program for  mirroring  a  directory  from  a
       remote ftp server. It allows regex-matching for files that
       are to be included and excluded. It uses a combination  of
       timestamp,  file  size and file permissions to decide what
       files to transfer from the ftp server.

       The primary goal of fmirror is to use as little memory  as
       possible,  but  still  be  able to do its job efficiently.
       fmirror can delete any  files  not  found  on  the  remote
       server.


OPTIONS
       -A mask
              Remote  file  permissions  will  be binary anded by
              mask before being compared.  The same mask is  also
              used  when  creating  files. Default value is 0111,
              which results in only executable  bits  being  mir­
              rored.   The  or mask will be ored in after the and
              mask is anded in.


       -O mask
              Remote file permissions will be binary ored by mask
              before  being  compared. The same mask is also used
              when creating files. Default value is  0444,  which
              results  in  all files being readable for everyone.
              This mask will be ored in after the  and  mask  has
              been anded in.


       -C line
              Parses line as if it was a line in a config-file.


       -N     Don't  delete  files  that are missing from the ftp
              server. Files that are replaced by files  of  other
              types will still be deleted and updated.


       -c command
              Use  command as a dir-command. To read a ls-lR file
              instead of performing a heavy ls-operation  on  the
              ftp-server,  use "RETR ls-lR". The default value is
              "LIST -lRa".


       -D command
              Use command as a dir-command for finding the remote
              timezone.   See also the equivalent dircmd_tz: con­
              figuration file keyword.


       -d debug-level
              The  level  of  debugging  (spam)  output  that  is
              wanted. The default debug-level is 3.


       -e exclude-opt exclude-pattern
              Add  an  exclude-entry. See discussion for exclude:
              in the configuration files section. The option  and
              pattern  must  be one word to the shell, so enclose
              both in a single "-pair, ie <fmirror -e "p  old/">.


       -i include-opt include-pattern
              Add  an  include-entry. See discussion for include:
              in the configuration files section.


       -f config-file
              Reads options from config-file.   See  the  section
              CONFIGURATION  FILES for more information about the
              contents of a config-file.


       -F pid-file
              Write the pid (process id) of the  fmirror  process
              to pid-file.  This is useful when you want to avoid
              running more than one copy of fmirror from cron  or
              similar.


       -h     Display brief option-summary.


       -k     Only  download  files that are newer than the local
              copy.


       -l local-dir
              Change directory to local-dir (locally) before mir­
              roring.


       -M use-MDTM
              set  the  flag for using MDTM exension.  Equivalent
              to the use_mdtm: keyword,  which  is  described  in
              detail in the configuration file section.

              mode.  Default value is 0755 (octal).



       -m mode
              All  local directories will be made with mode mode.
              Default value is 0755 (octal).


       -P port
              Connect to port port on the remote ftp server.


       -p password
              The password you want to use  on  the  ftp  server.
              When doing anonymous ftp, this should be your email
              address. If password is not specified, it be set to
              'username@',  where username is the username corre­
              sponding to the real UID of fmirror.


       -r remote-dir
              Change directory to remote-dir (on the ftp  server)
              before mirroring.


       -R     Set  timestamp of local files to the same as remote
              files (for resyncing the timestamps if you are sure
              the files are correct). Only sets the timestamps if
              file lengths and modes match according to the  nor­
              mal rules.


       -s hostname
              Use hostname as the ftp server to connect to.


       -S     Use  passive  mode  for  the ftp transfers. This is
              often necessary to get through some firewalls.


       -T remote-timezone
              The remote-timezone value  (in  minutes)  overrides
              the  guess  fmirror  will  do  on  the timezone the
              remote FTP server operates in.  Equivalent  to  the
              remotetz:  keyword, which is described in detail in
              the configuration file section.


       -t timefuzz
              Allow timestamps to differ by up to  timefuzz  sec­
              onds.  The default value is 59. No matter what this
              value is set to, files that differ by exactly  3600
              seconds  will always considered equal to compensate
              for buggy timezone-handling. Also, files older than
              60 days can differ by up to a day to compensate for
              lack of  precision  in  ls  listings  for  previous
              years.


       -u username
              Sets  your  username on the ftp server to username.
              For anonymous ftp, this should be ftp or anonymous.
              The default value is anonymous.


       -v     Show version.


       -V verbosity
              Verbosity  level, 1 is suitable for cron jobs and 3
              is suitable for interactive use. Default is 3.


       -x program
              Run program as a decompressor for the  ls  listing.
              This  will only be used if compressed dirlisting is
              on. This should ONLY be the name of the executable,
              it  must not contain any options. The default value
              is "gzip".


       -o option
              Give option as  option  to  the  decompressor.  The
              default value is "-dc".


       -z     Enable decompression of dir-listing.


CONFIGURATION FILES
       Unless  you are just using this program to mirror a direc­
       tory once, you'll probably want to  make  a  configuration
       file to make the job easier.

       The  syntax  of the configuration file is very simple. Any
       line not starting with an alphabetical letter  is  consid­
       ered  a comment line (blank lines are also considered com­
       ments).

       The first option of a particular kind has the highest pri­
       ority,  and  configuration  file  and command line options
       have the same priority. You can have any number of include
       and exclude options, the first one that matches a particu­
       lar file will be used.

       You can also include  multiple  configuration  files,  the
       first  configuration  file has precedence over later ones.
       The debug-level can be changed between every single option
       on the command-line to debug specific configuration files.

       NOTE: All numerical values can be written in octal  (lead­
       ing  0),  decimal  (default)  or hexadecimal (leading 0x).
       Modes are usually written in octal, so make sure you write
       0755 and not 755 (for example).


       username: username
              Sets the username (same as -u command line option).
              Any whitespace before the username will be ignored.
              This will typically be "ftp" or "anonymous".


       password: password
              Sets the password (same as -p command line option).
              Any whitespace before the password will be ignored.
              This   will  typically  be  "user@some.domain",  ie
              "finnag@fast.no"


       host: remote hostname
              Specifies the remote hostname (same as  -s  command
              line  option).  Any  whitespace before the hostname
              will be ignored.


       remotedir: remote directory
              Specifies the remote directory that is to  be  mir­
              rored.  (same  as  -r  command  line  option).  Any
              whitespace before the name will be ignored.


       localdir: local directory
              Specifies the local directory that you are  mirror­
              ing  to  (same  as  -l  command  line  option). Any
              whitespace before the name will be ignored.


       dircmd: directory list command
              Specifies what command should be sent to  the  ftp-
              server to get a directory listing. Normally this is
              "LIST -lRa". If  you  want  to  get  a  ls-lR  file
              instead, you can put "RETR ls-lR" here. This option
              is equivalent to the -c command line option.


       dircmd_tz: directory list command
              Specifies what command should be sent to  the  ftp-
              server  to  get  a directory listing when trying to
              find the remote timezone.   The  default  value  is
              "LIST  -ltra".   Should not be set to any recursive
              command.  Equivalent to the -D command line option.


       decompressor:
              If  you are getting a compressed file-listing, this
              should be the  name  of  the  decompressor  program
              without  any  options. This is set to "gzip" if you
              only enable compressed dir-listings without  speci­
              fying a decompressor. Equivalent to -x command line
              option.


       decompressor_opt:
              The option string that is to be sent to the  decom­
              pressor.  This  defaults to "-dc". Equivalent to -o
              command line option.


       port: port
              Connect to port port  on  the  remote  ftp  server.
              Equivalent to -P command line option.


       pidfile: pid-file
              Store  the  PID  (process id) of the process to the
              file  pid-file.   Equivalent  to  -F  command  line
              option.



       dirmode: mode
              All  local  directories  will  be created with mode
              mode.  Equivalent to -m command line option.


       loglevel: level
              Specifies the logging level (debug level).  Equiva­
              lent to -l command line option.


       compressed: val
              Takes  an integer argument, will enable decompress­
              ing of the file listing if val is non-zero. With  a
              non-zero value this is equivalent to the -z command
              line option.


       timefuzz: fuzz
              The maximum number of seconds files can  differ  by
              and  still  be  considered  equal. Equivalent to -t
              command line option.


       file_and_mask: mask
              File permissions will be anded by mask before being
              compared and created. Equivalent to -A command line
              option.


       file_or_mask: mask
              File  permissions  will  be  ored  by  file_or_mask
              before being created. Equivalent to -O command line
              option.


       passive: val
              Use passive mode if val is non-zero, or normal mode
              if it is zero.


       nodel: val
              Don't delete local files if val is non-zero (equiv­
              alent to -N command line option). Normal  operation
              if val is zero.


       log_timestamp: val
              Only  prepend  timestamp on each line output if val
              is non-zero. Default value is 1.


       verbosity: verbosity
              Chose verbosity value. The  only  supported  values
              are 1, which is suitable for non-interactive opera­
              tion, and 3,  which  is  suitable  for  interactive
              operation.


       keep_newer: val
              Takes  an integer argument, will keep newer file if
              val is non-zero. This means that remote files  that
              have  older  timestamps  than  local files will not
              cause that file to be retrieved. Equivalent  to  -k
              command line option.


       reset_times: val
              Takes  an  integer  argument,  will  reset times of
              files if val is non-zero.  This  means  that  files
              thay  only  differ in time-stamp, but match in size
              and mode, will get their local  timestamp  adjusted
              to  that  of  the  remote  files  instead  of being
              retrieved again.  Equivalent  to  -R  command  line
              option.


       remotetz: val
              Takes  an  integer argument.  The val is the remote
              timezone in minutes.  Typical values would  be  -60
              for  most  of Europe, -540 for Japan, anywhere from
              300 to 480 for the  continental  US,  and  600  for
              Hawaii.   Normally,  fmirror will only try to guess
              the timezone when use_mdtm is in effect, and assume
              GMT  in  all other cases.  Overriding the time zone
              guess is particularly important when you are fetch­
              ing  a  ls-lR  file  with  RETR instead of actually
              doing a LIST, since the guess  is  based  on  doing
              LIST and MDTM and comparing the results.


       use_mdtm: val
              Takes an integer argument.  The val decides whether
              to try using the MDTM extension for getting  remote
              modification  times.  To avoid constantly regetting
              files, this also needs to figure out what  timezone
              the  remote server is running in, by doing a remote
              "LIST -ltra", picking a file with time information,
              sending  an  MDTM command for it, and comparing the
              results.  See also  the  dircmd_tz:  and  remotetz:
              keywords.

              A  value  of  0 turns off trying MDTM, a value of 1
              means to use it if  it  is  available  and  we  can
              determine  the  remote  timezone,  while  any other
              value (preferably 2) means  to  use  it  if  it  is
              available  and  assume  that the remote timezone is
              GMT if we can't determine it normally.  In the last
              case,  using a large value for timefuzz (like 50000
              for a bit more than 12 hours) may also  be  useful.
              The default value is 1.


       input_timeout: num
              Will  wait  num  seconds before forcing a read of a
              file  to  time  out.  No  equivalent  command  line
              option, default value is 240 seconds.


       connect_timeout: num
              The  timeout  before  retrying  a connect operation
              (not the initial connect, but the connects that are
              required  to  transfer files after the control con­
              nection is up). Will wait num seconds before timing
              out  on  connects  (or  accepts for non-passive ftp
              transfers).  No  equivalent  command  line  option,
              default value is 120 seconds.


       connect_retries: num
              The  number  of  times to retry a connect operation
              (not the initial connect, but the connects that are
              required  to  transfer files after the control con­
              nection is up). Will try to connect up to num times
              before   giving  up.  No  equivalent  command  line
              option, default value is 3.


       reconnect_timeout: num
              Will wait num seconds  before  retrying  a  connect
              operation  to  a ftp server, either if there was no
              reply from the ftp server at  all  at  the  initial
              connect,  or if the username/password combo was not
              allowed (usually happens on full ftp  servers).  No
              equivalent  command  line  option, default value is
              120 seconds.


       reconnect_retries: num
              Will try to connect up to num times  before  giving
              up if initial connection cannot be made. This means
              that eitehr the ftp servre does not reply  at  all,
              or  fmirror is kicked out because the ftp server is
              full. No equivalent command  line  option,  default
              value is 15;




       exclude:  [i][x][n]{p|f} pattern
              A  regex  pattern  that, if matched in a particular
              file/path-name, should not be mirrored.  This  will
              override  any  include-patterns  encountered  after
              this. Equivalent to -e command line option.

              NOTE: An exclude-rule doesn't differ between  files
              or  directories.  p  or  f  only decide whether the
              entire  path-name  or  just   the   name   of   the
              file/directory  itself  should be matched. Directo­
              ries get  "/"  appended  before  they  are  matched
              against   the   regex,  so  "exclude f ^old/"  will
              exclude a directory named "old" (but not  necessar­
              ily its contents), but not a file named "old".

              Directories are created "on demand", so if you have
              excluded "old/" but not "\.gif$", a file with  path
              "old/bill.gif" will cause the "old"-directory to be
              made and the "bill.gif"-file to  be  retrieved.  To
              exclude  any directory named "old" and all its con­
              tents, use "p (^|/)old/".

              i means case insensitive match.

              x means to  match  anything  EXCEPT  the  following
              regex, effectively inverting the rule.

              n means that the file/directory will not be deleted
              if it exists locally, matches this rule, and  would
              otherwise be deleted.

              p means match full path-name (eg "pub/foo.bar").

              f means match filename only (eg "foo.bar")

              pattern is an extended POSIX regular expression.


       include:  [i][x][n]{p|f} pattern
              A  regex  pattern  that, if matched in a particular
              file/path-name, should be mirrored. This will over­
              ride  any  exclude-patterns encountered after this.
              Equivalent to -i command line option.

              The options are identical with the exclude options.


EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILES
       There  should  be  several sample configuration files with
       your copy of fmirror in the configs directory.


BUGS
       Transient errors are not handled well. If one file  cannot
       be  transferred  for  some reason, such as 'Failed to make
       data socket', it doesn't try to get that  file  again,  so
       you effectively lose the file.
