       README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Clas­
       sic).  If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't
       want to be here (unless you are in the Classic environment
       under Mac OS X).

       When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean pre-Mac OS X, which
       includes Mac OS 7, 8, and 9.

       The perl 5.6.1 source itself builds on Mac OS, with some
       additional pieces. Support for Mac OS is now in the perl
       core, and MacPerl will be able to, in the future, keep in
       closer sync with regular perl releases.

       At this time, though, it is very buggy, and is under
       development.  An alpha release is coming very soon.

       To build perl for Mac OS (as an MPW tool), you will need
       the addition of the "macos" subdirectory, distributed sep­
       arately.  It includes extra source files, config files,
       and make files.  It also includes a lot of extra Mac-spe­
       cific modules.

       To build the MacPerl application, you will also need the
       "macperl" directory, which includes the source files for
       creating the application itself.

       All of this is also available from the SourceForge site,
       via HTTP, FTP, and anonymous CVS.

               http://macperl.sourceforge.net/

       You will also need compilers and libraries, all of them
       freely available.  These are linked to from the Source­
       Forge site. Go that site for all things having to do with
       MacPerl development.

       MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is available on the CPAN and on Source­
       Forge.  It is based on perl 5.004.

AAUUTTHHOORR
       perl was ported to Mac OS by Matthias Neeracher <neer­
       acher@mac.com>.  It is currently maintained by Chris Nan­
       dor <pudge@pobox.com>.
