CHARSET(1)             Linux User's Manual             CHARSET(1)



NAME
       charset  -  Set an ACM for use in one of the G0/G1 charset
       slots.


SYNOPSIS
       charset [-v] G0|G1 [cp437|iso01|vt100|user|<acm_name>]


DESCRIPTION
       The linux console has 2 slots for charsets, labeled G0 and
       G1.   charset changes the slot in use by the current VT to
       either G0 or G1, and fills the slot either with one of the
       3  predefined  ACMs  (cp437, iso01, vt100) or with a user-
       defined ACM.

       You can ask for the current user-defined ACM by specifying
       user,  or  ask a new ACM to be loaded from a file into the
       user slot, by specifying a filename.

       You will note that, although each VT has its own slot set­
       tings, there is only one user-defined ACM for all the VTs.
       That is, whereas you can  have  tty1  using  G0=cp437  and
       G1=vt100,  at  the  same  time  as tty2 using G0=iso01 and
       G1=iso02 (user-defined), you cannot have at the same  time
       tty1  using iso02 and tty2 using iso03.  This is a limita­
       tion of the linux kernel.

       Note that you can emulate such a setting  using  the  fil­
       term(1)  utility,  with  your  console  in  UTF8-mode,  by
       telling filterm to translate screen output  on-the-fly  to
       UTF8.

       You'll  find  filterm(1)  in  the  konwert(1)  package, by
       Marcin    Kowalczyk,    which    is     available     from
       http://qrczak.home.ml.org/.


OPTIONS
       -v     be  verbose.   charset will then print what it does
              as it does it.


BUGS
       charset cannot determine which of the 2 slots is in use at
       a  given time, so you have to tell him which one you want,
       even if you don't want to change to the other  one.   This
       is a limitation of the console driver.
