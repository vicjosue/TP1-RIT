NAME
       config.guess - guess the build system triplet

SYNOPSIS
       config.guess [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       The   GNU   build  system  distinguishes  three  types  of
       machines, the `build' machine on which the  compilers  are
       run,  the  `host' machine on which the package being built
       will run, and, exclusively  when  you  build  a  compiler,
       assembler  etc.,  the `target' machine, for which the com­
       piler being built will produce code.

       This script will guess the type of the `build' machine.

       Output the configuration name of the system `config.guess'
       is run on.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -t, --time-stamp
              print date of last modification, then exit

       -v, --version
              print version number, then exit

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       config.guess  might  need to compile and run C code, hence
       it needs a compiler for the `build' machine: use the envi­
       ronment  variable  `CC_FOR_BUILD'  to specify the compiler
       for the build machine.  If `CC_FOR_BUILD'  is  not  speci­
       fied,   `CC'   will   be   used.    Be   sure  to  specify
       `CC_FOR_BUILD' is `CC' is a cross-compiler to  the  `host'
       machine.

         CC_FOR_BUILD    a native C compiler, defaults to `cc'
         CC               a native C compiler, the previous vari­
       able is preferred
