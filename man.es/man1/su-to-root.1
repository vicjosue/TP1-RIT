su-to-root(1)        Debian GNU/Linux manual        su-to-root(1)



NAME
       su-to-root  -  A  simple  script  to give an `interactive'
       front end to su.  It can be used in menu entry commands to
       ask for the root password


DESCRIPTION
       Most  menu  entries  simply  start  an editor or a game or
       whatever. But some menu entries would  like  to  give  the
       user  the ability to change important settings in the sys­
       tem, that require root privileges.  su-to-root can be used
       to ask for the root password.
