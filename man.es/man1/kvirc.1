NAME
       KVIrc - an Internet Relay Chat client.

SYNOPSIS
       kvirc  [-h]  [--help]  [-v]  [--version] [-c <configfile>]
       [server [port]]


DESCRIPTION
       KVIrc is a Visual Internet Relay Chat client based on  the
       Qt library.

       It  is  intended to be an "user friendly" interface to the
       IRC protocol (see RFC1459) and its extensions.


OPTIONS
       KVIrc accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
               Display a list of all commandline options.

       -v, --version
               Output the version info.

       -c <configfile>
               Use <configfile> as configuration file instead  of
               ~/.kvircrc .

       [server]
               Connect to this server upon startup.

       [port]  Use  this  port  to  connect  to the server.  This
               option requires also a server name.



       ENVIRONMENT


       LANG    Language  setting.   If  not  set   (or   set   to
               'EN','POSIX'  or  'C')  KVIrc will use the default
               language (english).



       FILES   $PREFIX/share/kvirc/config/*.conf Default configu­
              ration files.  These are loaded the first time that
              KVIrc runs to provide a set of default options.

              $PREFIX/share/kvirc/help/*   Directory   containing
              help files.

              $PREFIX/share/kvirc/locale/*.mo Localization string
              archives.

              $PREFIX/share/kvirc/pics/* Images  used  internally
              by KVIrc.

              $HOME/.kvircrc  This  is  the first file that KVIrc
              looks for.  If the -c commandline option is  speci­
              fied  ,  the file passed as the option parameter is
              used instead of this one.  If the file is  found  ,
              KVIrc  reads the first non-empty line and treats it
              as the path to the KVIrc Local directory.   If  the
              file  can not be found or the KVIrc Local directory
              is not existing , KVIrc enters the setup  mode  and
              allows selecting a new KVIrc Local directory.

              KVIrc Local directory/config/*.conf User configura­
              tion files.

              KVIrc Local directory/help/ Directory used to store
              search results.

              KVIrc  Local  directory/incoming/ Default directory
              for DCC incoming transfers.

              KVIrc Local directory/log Directory  used  for  the
              logs

              KVIrc  Local  directory/pics  Local  directory  for
              images.  By placing images in  this  directory  you
              can     "override"     the     ones     in    $PRE­
              FIX/share/kvirc/pics/* . This is a  way  to  use  a
              personal set of images.

              KVIrc  Local  directory/scripts  Directory  used to
              save/load KVIrc scripts
