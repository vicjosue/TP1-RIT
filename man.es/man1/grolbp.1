DESCRIPTION
       grolbp is a driver for groff that produces output in CAPSL
       and  VDM  format suitable for Canon LBP-4 and LBP-8 print­
       ers.

       For compatibility with grolj4 there is an additional draw­
       ing command available:

       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw  a  rule  (i.e. a solid black rectangle), with
              one corner at the current position, and the  diago­
              nally  opposite  corner  at  the  current  position
              +(dh,dv).

OPTIONS
       Note that there can be  whitespace  between  a  one-letter
       option  and its argument; on the other hand, there must be
       whitespace and/or an equal sign (`=') between a  long-name
       option and its argument.

       -cnumcopies
       --copies=numcopies
              Print numcopies copies of each page.

       -l
       --landscape
              Print the document with a landscape orientation.

       -ppaper_size
       --papersize=paper_size
              Set  the  paper size to paper_size, which must be a
              valid paper size description as  indicated  in  the
              section PAPER SIZES.

       -oorientation
       --orientation=orientation
              Print  the  document  with orientation orientation,
              which must be `portrait' or `landscape'.

       -v
       --version
              Print the version number.

       -Fdir
       --fontdir=dir
              Prepend directory dir/devlbp to the search path for
              font and device description files.

       -h
       --help Print a short help text.

TYPEFACES
       The  driver  supports  the  Dutch,  Swiss and Swiss-Narrow
       scalable typefaces, each one in the Regular, Bold,  Italic
       and  Bold-Italic  styles.   Additionally,  the Courier and
       Elite monospaced typefaces at the sizes 8  and  12  points
       (for  Courier)  resp. 8 and 10 points (for Elite) are sup­
       ported, each one in the Regular, Bold and Italic styles.

       The following chart summarizes the font names you can  use
       to access these fonts:

    +----------------+-----------+--------+----------+--------------+
    |   Typeface     |  Regular  |  Bold  |  Italic  |  Bold-Italic |
    +----------------+-----------+--------+----------+--------------+
    | Dutch          |    TR     |   TB   |    TI    |      TBI     |
    +----------------+-----------+--------+----------+--------------+

PAPER SIZES
       The paper size can be set in the DESC file or with command
       line options to grolbp.  If the paper  size  is  specified
       both  ways,  the command line options take precedence over
       the contents of the DESC file (this applies  to  the  page
       orientation too).

       To  set  the  paper  size in the DESC file, insert in that
       file a line containing papersize desired_papersize,  where
       desired_papersize is:

       ·   One  of  the  recognized  paper sizes: `a4', `letter',
           `legal' or `executive'.

       ·   A custom defined paper size, as described in the  CUS­
           TOM PAPER SIZES subsection below.

       ·   The  name of a file (e.g.  /etc/papersize) whose first
           line must be the desired paper  size  in  one  of  the
           above formats.

       If  there  are  various  papersize lines in the DESC file,
       only the first valid one is used.

       To set the paper size in the command line, add

         -p desired_papersize

       or

         --papersize=desired_papersize

       to the other grolbp options, where desired_papersize is in
       the same format as in the DESC file.

       Paper  sizes  are case insensitive (i.e., `A4' is the same
       as `a4').

       If no paper size is specified in the DESC file or the com­
       mand line, a default size of A4 is used.


       CUSTOM PAPER SIZES
              Custom   defined   paper  sizes  are  in  the  form
              custlengthxwidth where length  and  width  are  the
              dimensions  of the paper you want to to use, speci­
              fied in printer units  (1/300  of  an  inch).   For
              instance,  to print in a postcard sized paper which
              is two inches long and four  inches  wide  you  can
              insert a line containing

                papersize cust600x1200

              at the beginning of the DESC file.

PAGE ORIENTATION
       As with the page size, the orientation of the printed page
       (portrait or landscape) can be set in  the  DESC  file  or
       with command line options.  It is also case insensitive.

       To  set  the  orientation  in the DESC file, insert a line
       with the following content:

         orientation [portrait|landscape]

       As with paper sizes, only the first valid orientation com­
       mand in the DESC file is used.

       To  set the page orientation with command line options you
       can use the -o  or  --orientation  option  with  the  same
       parameters  (portrait  or  landscape) as in the DESC file.
       Or you can use the -l option to  force  the  pages  to  be
       printed in landscape.

FONT FILE FORMAT
       In   addition   to   the   usual   commands  described  in
       groff_font(5), grolbp provides the command  lbpname  which
       sets  the  font  name  sent to the printer when requesting
       this font.  The syntax of this command is:

         lbpname printer_font_name

       ·      For bitmapped fonts, printer_font_name has the form

                N<base_fontname><font_style>

              base_fontname is the font name as it appears in the
              printers font listings without the first letter, up
              to  (but  not including) the font size.  font_style
              can be one of the letters R, I,  or  B,  indicating
              the  font  styles  Roman,  Italic  and Bold respec­
              tively.

              For instance, if the printer's font listing A shows
              font  `Nelite12I.ISO_USA',  the corresponding entry
              in the font description file is

                lbpname NeliteI

              Note that you may need to modify grolbp to add sup­
              port  for  new bitmapped fonts, since the available
              font names and font sizes of  bitmapped  fonts  (as
              documented  above) are hard-coded into the program.

       ·      For scalable fonts, printer_font_name is  identical
              to  the  font  name  as it appears in the printer's
              font listing A.

              For instance, to select the `Swiss'  font  in  bold
              style,  which appears in the printer's font listing
              A as `Swiss-Bold',  the  required  lbpname  command
              line is

                lbpname Swiss-Bold


       The argument of lbpname is case sensitive.
