PCL3OPTS(1)                                           PCL3OPTS(1)



NAME
       pcl3opts  --  determine options for the ghostscript driver
       pcl3 from a PCL-3+ file

SYNOPSIS
       pcl3opts [-o output_file]  [input_file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The command pcl3opts is intended to  help  in  determining
       which  options  one  should  use  when calling ghostscript
       using pcl3 for driving a PCL-3+ printer.  It analyzes  one
       or  more PCL input_files and issues on the output_file its
       best guess as to which options one should specify in order
       to  produce  files  using  a  similar  configuration.  The
       default output_file is standard output.  If no input_files
       are specified, the command reads from standard input.

       This  command  is mostly of interest if you have access to
       PCL files generated by software provided by the  printer's
       manufacturer,  for example if you have a manufacturer-sup≠
       plied Microsoft Windows driver for your printer.  In  that
       case you can generate a few files under Windows using dif≠
       ferent settings and let pcl3opts examine them.

LIMITATIONS
       Note that pcl3opts cannot guarantee that the collection of
       options it proposes leads to a file which is understood by
       the printer.  It can merely provide a best guess.

       In addition, some settings require interpretation  of  the
       page  contents  in  order  to properly translate them into
       options for pcl3 and some cannot reliably be derived  from
       a  PCL file at all.  Finding good values for these parame≠
       ters is beyond  pcl3opts's  capabilities.   This  includes
       LeadingEdge,  SendBlackLast,  Tumble  and  the distinction
       between the colour models CMY+K and CMYK.
