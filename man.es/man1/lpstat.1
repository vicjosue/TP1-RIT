DESCRIPTION
       lpstat  displays  status  information  about  the  current
       classes,  jobs,  and printers. When run with no arguments,
       lpstat will list jobs queued by the  user.  Other  options
       include:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -a [printer(s)]
            Shows  the  accepting  state of printer queues. If no
            printers are specified then all printers are  listed.

       -c [class(es)]
            Shows  the  printer  classes  and  the  printers that
            belong to them. If no classes are specified then  all
            classes are listed.

       -d
            Shows the current default destination.

       -h server
            Specifies the CUPS server to communicate with.

       -l
            Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.

       -o [destination(s)]
            Shows  the  jobs queue on the specified destinations.
            If no destinations are specified all jobs are  shown.

       -p [printer(s)]
            Shows  the  printers  and  whether  or  not  they are
            enabled for printing. If no  printers  are  specified
            then all printers are listed.

       -r
            Shows whether or not the CUPS server is running.

       -R
            Shows the ranking of print jobs.

       -s
            Shows  a status summary, including the system default
            destination, a  list  of  classes  and  their  member
            printers, and a list of printers and their associated
            devices. This is equivalent to using the "-d",  "-c",
            and "-p" options.

       -t
            Shows  all  status information. This is equivalent to
            using the "-r", "-d", "-c", "-d", "-v",  "-a",  "-p",
            and "-o" options.

       -u [user(s)]
            Shows  a  list  of print jobs queued by the specified
            users. If no users  are  specified,  lists  the  jobs
            queued by the current user.

       -v [printer(s)]
            Shows  the printers and what device they are attached
            to. If no printers are specified  then  all  printers
            are listed.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the  System V printing system, CUPS allows printer
       names to contain any printable character except SPACE  and
       TAB. Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The "-h" option is not a standard System V option.

       The Solaris "-f", "-P",  and  "-S"  options  are  silently
       ignored.
