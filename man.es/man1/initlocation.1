NAME
       initlocation  -  create  a  secondary  PostgreSQL database
       storage area

SYNOPSIS
       initlocation directory

DESCRIPTION
       initlocation creates a new PostgreSQL  secondary  database
       storage  area.   See  the discussion under CREATE DATABASE
       [create_database(7)] about how to manage and use secondary
       storage  areas.  If  the argument does not contain a slash
       and is not valid as a path, it is assumed to be  an  envi­
       ronment variable, which is referenced. See the examples at
       the end.

       In order to use this command you must be logged in  (using
       su, for example) as the database superuser.

USAGE
       To  create  a  database in an alternate location, using an
       environment variable:

       $ export PGDATA2=/opt/postgres/data

       Stop and start postmaster so it sees the PGDATA2  environ­
       ment  variable. The system must be configured so the post­
       master sees PGDATA2 every time it starts. Finally:

       $ initlocation PGDATA2
       $ createdb -D PGDATA2 testdb



       Alternatively, if  you  allow  absolute  paths  you  could
       write:

       $ initlocation /opt/postgres/data
       $ createdb -D /opt/postgres/data/testdb testdb
