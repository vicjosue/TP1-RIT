SSH-COPY-ID(1)                                     SSH-COPY-ID(1)



NAME
       ssh-copy-id  -  install  your  identity.pub  in  a  remote
       machine's authorized_keys

SYNOPSIS
       ssh-copy-id [-i [identity_file]] [user@]machine

DESCRIPTION
       ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh to log into a remote
       machine  (presumably  using  a login password, so password
       authentication should be enabled, unless you've done  some
       clever use of multiple identities)

       It also changes the permissions of the remote user's home,
       ~/.ssh,  and  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   to   remove   group
       writability  (which  would otherwise prevent you from log­
       ging in, if the remote sshd has  StrictModes  set  in  its
       configuration).

       If the -i option is given then the identity file (defaults
       to ~/.ssh/identity.pub) is  used,  regardless  of  whether
       there are any keys in your ssh-agent.  Otherwise, if this:

             ssh-add -L

       provides any output, it uses that  in  preference  to  the
       identity file.

       If  the -i option is used, or the ssh-add produced no out­
       put, then it uses the contents of the identity file.  Once
       it  has  one  or  more fingerprints (by whatever means) it
       uses ssh to append them to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  on  the
       remote  machine (creating the file, and directory, if nec­
       essary)
