NAME
       grohtml - html driver for groff

SYNOPSIS
       grohtml [ -v?lrn ] [ -Ddir ] [ -Fdir ] [ -iresolution ]
               [ -Iimage ] [ -oimage ] [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION
       grohtml translates the output of GNU troff to html.  Users
       should  always invoke grohtml via the groff command with a
       -Thtml option.  If no files are given, grohtml  will  read
       the  standard input.  A filename of - will also cause gro­
       html to read the standard input.  Html output  is  written
       to  the  standard  output.   When  grohtml is run by groff
       options can be passed to grohtml using groff's -P  option.

OPTIONS
       -v     Displays the version.

       -?     Emits a usage synopsis.

       -l     Turns off the production of automatic section links
              at the top of the document.

       -r     Turns off the  automatic  header  and  footer  line
              (html rule).

       -n     Generate  simple  heading  anchors  whenever a sec­
              tion/number heading is found.  Without  the  option
              the  anchor value is the textual heading.  This can
              cause problems when a heading  contains  a  `?'  on
              some  brousers  (netscape).  This flag is automati­
              cally turned on if a heading contains an image.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to  the  search  path
              for  font and device description files; name is the
              name of the device, usually html.

       -iresolution
              Select the resolution for all images.   By  default
              this  is  80 pixels per inch.  Example: -i100 indi­
              cates 100 pixels per inch.

       -Istem Determine the image stem name.  If omitted  grohtml
              uses grohtml-XXX (XXX is the process ID).

       -Ddir  Inform grohtml to place all image files into direc­
              tory dir.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -?     Display usage.

USAGE
       There are styles called R, I, B, and BI  mounted  at  font
       positions 1 to 4.

DEPENDENCIES
       grohtml    is    dependent    upon   the   png   utilities
       (pnmcut, pnmtopng) and GhostScript (gs).  Images are  gen­
       erated  whenever  a  table,  picture,  equation or line is
       encountered.

BUGS
       Grohtml has been completely redesigned and rewritten.   It
       is still alpha code.
