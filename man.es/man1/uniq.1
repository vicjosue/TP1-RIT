NAME
       uniq - remove duplicate lines from a sorted file

SYNOPSIS
       uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

DESCRIPTION
       Discard  all  but  one  of successive identical lines from
       INPUT (or standard input), writing to OUTPUT (or  standard
       output).

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are mandatory for
       short options too.

       -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences

       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines

       -D, --all-repeated[=delimit-method]  print  all  duplicate
       lines
              delimit-method={none(default),prepend,separate)}
              Delimiting is done with blank lines.

       -f, --skip-fields=N
              avoid comparing the first N fields

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore differences in case when comparing

       -s, --skip-chars=N
              avoid comparing the first N characters

       -u, --unique
              only print unique lines

       -w, --check-chars=N
              compare no more than N characters in lines

       -N     same as -f N

       +N     same as -s N (obsolescent; will be withdrawn)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       A  field is a run of whitespace, then non-whitespace char­
       acters.  Fields are skipped before chars.
