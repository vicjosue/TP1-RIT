       One can read this document in the following formats:

               man perlamiga
               multiview perlamiga.guide

       to list some (not all may be available simultaneously), or
       it may be read as is: either as README.amiga, or pod/per­
       lamiga.pod.

       A recent version of perl for the Amiga can be found at the
       Geek Gadgets section of the Aminet:

             You need the Unix emulation for AmigaOS, whose most
             important part is iixxeemmuull..lliibbrraarryy. For a minimum
             setup, get the latest versions of the following
             packages from the Aminet archives
             (http://www.aminet.net/~aminet/):

                     ixemul-bin
                     ixemul-env-bin
                     pdksh-bin

             Note also that this is a minimum setup; you might
             want to add other packages of AADDEE (the Amiga Devel­
             opers Environment).

       VVeerrssiioonn ooff AAmmiiggaa OOSS
             You need at the very least AmigaOS version 2.0. Rec­
             ommended is version 3.1.

       SSttaarrttiinngg PPeerrll pprrooggrraammss uunnddeerr AAmmiiggaaOOSS

       Start your Perl program foo with arguments "arg1 arg2
       arg3" the same way as on any other platform, by

               perl foo arg1 arg2 arg3

       If you want to specify perl options "-my_opts" to the perl
       itself (as opposed to to your program), use

               perl -my_opts foo arg1 arg2 arg3

       Alternately, you can try to get a replacement for the sys­
       tem's EExxeeccuuttee command that honors the #!/usr/bin/perl syn­
       tax in scripts and set the s-Bit of your scripts. Then you
       can invoke your scripts like under UNIX with

               foo arg1 arg2 arg3

       (Note that having *nixish full path to perl /usr/bin/perl
       is not necessary, perl would be enough, but having full
       path would make it easier to use your script under *nix.)

       Perl under AmigaOS lacks some features of perl under UNIX
       because of deficiencies in the UNIX-emulation, most
       notably:

       ·   fork()

       ·   some features of the UNIX filesystem regarding link
           count and file dates

       ·   inplace operation (the --ii switch) without backup file

       ·   umask() works, but the correct permissions are only
           set when the file is finally close()d

IINNSSTTAALLLLAATTIIOONN
       Change to the installation directory (most probably ADE:),
       and extract the binary distribution:

       lha -mraxe x perl-$VERSION-bin.lha

       or

       tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION-bin.tgz

       (Of course you need lha or tar and gunzip for this.)

       For installation of the Unix emulation, read the appropri­
       ate docs.

       MMaannppaaggeess

       If you have "man" installed on your system, and you
       installed perl manpages, use something like this:

               man perlfunc
               man less
               man ExtUtils.MakeMaker

       to access documentation for different components of Perl.
       Start with

               man perl

       Note: You have to modify your man.conf file to search for
       manpages in the /ade/lib/perl5/man/man3 directory, or the
       man pages for the perl library will not be found.

       Note that dot (.) is used as a package separator for docu­
       mentation for packages, and as usual, sometimes you need
       to give the section - "3" above - to avoid shadowing by
       the less(1) manpage.

       HHTTMMLL

       If you have some WWW browser available, you can build HHTTMMLL
       docs.  Cd to directory with .pod files, and do like this

               cd /ade/lib/perl5/pod
               pod2html

       After this you can direct your browser the file perl.html
       in this directory, and go ahead with reading docs.

       Alternatively you may be able to get these docs prebuilt
       from "CPAN".

       GGNNUU ""iinnffoo"" ffiilleess

       Users of "Emacs" would appreciate it very much, especially
       with "CPerl" mode loaded. You need to get latest
       "pod2info" from "CPAN", or, alternately, prebuilt info
       pages.

       ""LLaaTTeeXX"" ddooccss

       can be constructed using "pod2latex".

BBUUIILLDD
       Here we discuss how to build Perl under AmigaOS.

       PPrreerreeqquuiissiitteess

       You need to have the latest iixxeemmuull (Unix emulation for
       Amiga) from Aminet.

       GGeettttiinngg tthhee ppeerrll ssoouurrccee

       You can either get the latest perl-for-amiga source from
       Ninemoons and extract it with:

         tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION-src.tgz

       or get the official source from CPAN:

         http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/5.0

       Extract it like this

         tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION.tar.gz

       You will see a message about errors while extracting Con­
       figure. This is normal and expected. (There is a conflict
       with a similarly-named file configure, but it causes no
       harm.)

       ·   remember to use a healthy sized stack (I used 2000000)

       ·   your PATH environment variable must include /bin (e.g.
           ".:/bin" is good) (or, more precisely, it must include
           the directory where you have your basic UNIX utilities
           like test, cat, sed, and so on)

       ·
             sh Configure -Dprefix=/ade -Dloclibpth=/ade/lib


       ·   fix makedepend

                   In the file 'makedepend' there are three spots like this `$cat ...`:
                   a for loop near line 75, an egrep near line 161, and a for loop near
                   line 175.  In all those spots using an editor change the $cat to
                   /bin/cat.


       ·   now type make depend

                   When the make depend has ended load the gnumakefile into
                   an editor and go to the end of the file.

                   Move upwards in the file until you reach av.o: EXTERN.h
                   and delete all lines down to # WARNING: Put....


       ·   now go to the x2p directory

                   Load the gnumakefile into an editor.

                   Go to the end moveup until you reach hash.o: EXTERN.h
                   and delete all lines dowonwards until you reach a line saying

                   # WARNING: Put nothing....


       ·   Now!

             make


       TTeessttiinngg

       Now run

         make test

       Some tests will be skipped because they need the fork()
       function:

       io/pipe.t, op/fork.t, lib/filehand.t, lib/open2.t,
       lib/open3.t, lib/io_pipe.t, lib/io_sock.t
