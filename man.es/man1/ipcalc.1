NAME
       ipcalc - perform simple manipulation of IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
       ipcalc [OPTION]... <IP address>[/prefix] [netmask]


DESCRIPTION
       ipcalc  provides  a simple way to calculate IP information
       for a host.  The various options specify what  information
       ipcalc  should  display  on standard out. Multiple options
       may be specified.  An IP address to operate on must always
       be specified.  Most operations also require a netmask or a
       CIDR prefix as well.


OPTIONS
       -b, --broadcast
              Display the broadcast address for the  given
              IP address and netmask.


       -h, --hostname
              Display   the  hostname  for  the  given  IP
              address.


       -m, --netmask
              Calculate  the  netmask  for  the  given  IP
              address.  It  assumes that the IP address is
              in a complete class A, B, or C network. Many
              networks do not use the default netmasks, in
              which case an inappropriate  value  will  be
              returned.


       -p, --prefix
              Show   the  prefix  for  the  given  mask/IP
              address.


       -n, --network
              Display the network address for the given IP
              address and netmask.


       -s, --silent
              Don't ever display error messages.
