NAME
       pamchannel - extract channels from a PAM image


SYNOPSIS
       pamchannel [ -infile infile ] [channum] ...

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique pre­
       fix.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PAM or PNM image as input.  Produces a  PAM  image
       as  output,  consisting  of  the indicated channels of the
       input.

       The output is the same dimensions  as  the  input,  except
       that the depth is the number of channum arguments you sup­
       ply.  The tuple type is a null string.



OPTIONS
       -infile infile
              This specifies the input file,  which  defaults  to
              Standard  Input.  You may specify - to select Stan­
              dard Input explicitly.

              This is a little  unconventional  for  Netpbm  pro­
              grams, which usually have the input file specifica­
              tion as an argument.  For pamchannel, the arguments
              are channel numbers.
