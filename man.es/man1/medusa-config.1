NAME
       medusa-config  -  get  compilation  options  needed to use
       medusa libraries

SYNOPSIS
       medusa-config
              [ --prefix=directory ] [ --exec_prefix=directory  ]
              --cflags  |  --libs  |  --prefix  | --exec-prefix |
              --version | --help

DESCRIPTION
       medusa-config provides information about the command  line
       options needed to use the medusa libraries.

       These options change medusa-config's idea of the installa­
       tion prefix:

       --prefix=directory
              Act as if medusa files had been installed into  the
              specified directory

       --exec_prefix=directory
              Act  as  if  medusa  executables had been installed
              into the specified directory

       These options  specify  what  you  want  medusa-config  to
       report.  At least one of these must be specified.

       --cflags
              Report  the  flags  that  need to be given to the C
              compiler to use the medusa libraries

       --libs Report the flags that need to be  given  to  the  C
              compiler to link against the medusa libraries

       --prefix
              Report  the  prefix directory into which the medusa
              files were installed

       --exec_prefix
              Report the prefix directory into which  the  medusa
              executables were installed.

       --version
              Report the version of medusa that is installed

       This   option  provides  information  about  medusa-config
       itself:

       --help Summarize the options available for  medusa-config.
