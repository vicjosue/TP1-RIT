NAME
       chfn - change your finger information

SYNOPSIS
       chfn  [ -f full-name ]  [ -o office ]  [ -p office-phone ]
       [ -h home-phone ] [ -u ] [ -v ] [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
       chfn is used to  change  your  finger  information.   This
       information is stored in the /etc/passwd file, and is dis­
       played by the finger program.  The  Linux  finger  command
       will  display  four  pieces  of  information  that  can be
       changed by chfn : your  real  name,  your  work  room  and
       phone, and your home phone.

   COMMAND LINE
       Any  of the four pieces of information can be specified on
       the command line.  If no information is given on the  com­
       mand line, chfn enters interactive mode.

   INTERACTIVE MODE
       In  interactive mode, chfn will prompt for each field.  At
       a prompt, you can enter the new information, or just press
       return  to  leave  the field unchanged.  Enter the keyword
       "none" to make the field blank.
