       %A     locale's full weekday name, variable  length  (Sun­
              day..Saturday)

       %b     locale's abbreviated month name (Jan..Dec)

       %B     locale's  full  month  name,  variable length (Jan­
              uary..December)

       %c     locale's date and time (Sat  Nov  04  12:02:33  EST
              1989)

       %d     day of month (01..31)

       %D     date (mm/dd/yy)

       %e     day of month, blank padded ( 1..31)

       %H     hour (00..23)

       %I     hour (01..12)

       %j     day of year (001..366)

       %k     hour ( 0..23)

       %l     hour ( 1..12)

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %p     locale's AM or PM

       %r     time, 12-hour (hh:mm:ss [AP]M)

       %s     seconds  since  `00:00:00  1970-01-01  UTC'  (a GNU
              extension)

       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a horizontal tab

       %T     time, 24-hour (hh:mm:ss)

       %U     week number of year with Sunday  as  first  day  of
              week (00..53)

       %V     week  number  of  year  with Monday as first day of
              week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6);  0 represents Sunday

       %W     week number of year with Monday  as  first  day  of
              week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (mm/dd/yy)

       %X     locale's time representation (%H:%M:%S)

       %y     last two digits of year (00..99)

       %Y     year (1970...)

       %z     RFC-822  style numeric timezone (-0500) (a nonstan­
              dard extension)

       %Z     time zone (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no  time  zone
              is determinable

       By  default,  date  pads  numeric fields with zeroes.  GNU
       date recognizes the following modifiers between `%' and  a
       numeric directive.

              `-'  (hyphen) do not pad the field `_' (underscore)
              pad the field with spaces
