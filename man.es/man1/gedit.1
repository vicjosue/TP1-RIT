       --debug[-section]

              functions  that  are beeing called dump to the con­
              sole the  function  names.  Specific  sections  for
              debugging can be specified, the sections are : win­
              dow,  commands,  document,  file,  plugins,  prefs,

              --help  or more information.

              Specifies the file to open when gedit starts  -  if
              this is not specified, gedit will load a blank file
              with an  Untitled  label.  Multiple  files  can  be
              loaded if they are separated by spaces.

PIPES
       Gedit acepts pipes, so it can be run after another command
       to load the ouptup into gedit. For example :

       ls -l | gedit
