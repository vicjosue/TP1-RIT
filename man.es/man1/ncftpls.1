NAME
       ncftpls - Internet file transfer program for scripts

SYNOPSIS
       ncftpls [options] ftp://url.style/host/path/name/

OPTIONS
   Command line flags:
       -1      Most basic format, one item per line.

       -l      Long list format.

       -x -XX  Additional ls flags to pass on to the server.

       -u XX   Use username XX instead of anonymous.

       -p XX   Use password XX with the username.

       -P XX   Use port number XX instead of the default FTP ser­
               vice port (21).

       -d XX   Use the file XX for debug logging.

       -t XX   Timeout after XX seconds.

       -E      Use regular (PORT) data connections.

       -F      Use passive (PASV) data connections.  The  default
               is  to  use passive, but to fallback to regular if
               the passive connection fails or times out.

       -r XX   Redial a maximum of XX times  until  connected  to
               the remote FTP server.

       -W XX   Send raw FTP command XX after logging in.

       -X XX   Send  raw  FTP  command  XX after each file trans­
               ferred.

       -Y XX   Send raw FTP command XX before logging out.

               The -W, -X, and -Y options are useful for advanced
               users  who need to tweak behavior on some servers.
               For example, users accessing mainframes might need
               to  send  some special SITE commands to set block­
               size and record format information.

               For these options, you can use them multiple times
               each  if  you need to send multiple commands.  For
               the -X option, you can use the cookie %s to expand
               into the name of the file that was transferred.

DESCRIPTION
       The  purpose of ncftpls is to do remote directory listings
       using the  File  Transfer  Protocol  without  entering  an
       interactive  shell.   This lets you write shell scripts or
       other unattended processes that can do FTP.

       The default behavior is to print the directory listing  in
       columnized format (i.e. ls -CF), but that is not very use­
       ful for scripting.  This example  uses  the  -1  flag,  to
       print one file per line:

           $ ncftpls -1 ftp://ftp.ncftp.com/pub/ncftp/

       You  can  also do a remote "ls -l", by using "ncftpls -l".
       If you want to try other flags, you have to use them  with
       the  -x  flag.   For example, if you wanted to do a remote
       "ls -lrt", you could do this:

           $ ncftpls -x "-lrt" ftp://ftp.ncftp.com/pub/ncftp/

       By default the program tries to open the remote  host  and
       login  anonymously,  but  you  can  specify a username and
       password information like you can with ncftpget or  ncftp­
       put.

DIAGNOSTICS
       ncftpls returns the following exit values:

       0       Success.

       1       Could not connect to remote host.

       2       Could not connect to remote host - timed out.

       3       Transfer failed.

       4       Transfer failed - timed out.

       5       Directory change failed.

       6       Directory change failed - timed out.

       7       Malformed URL.

       8       Usage error.

       9       Error in login configuration file.

       10      Library initialization failed.
