ml85p(1)         Driver for ML-85G laser printer         ml85p(1)



NAME
       ml85p - driver for Samsung ML-85G GDI printers

SYNOPSIS
       ml85p [-ERsr] [-f filename] [-t topskip] [-l leftskip]


DESCRIPTION
       The ml85p is a user level driver for the Samsung ML-85G, a
       GDI printer (winprinter), that can't be driven  solely  by
       the  resident  linux  kernel  code.   It  can  send to the
       printer already formated  pbmraw  image  files  (with  the
       switch  -f)  or get data from a pipe, usually generated by
       ghostscript or other postscript to pbmraw translator.

OPTIONS
       -R reset (only) the printer, to be sent only aftwer  power
       on.  To  reset  and following print a document, see the -r
       switch.

       -E  place  the  printer  in  the   energy   saving   state
       (optional).

       -s simulate the printing process, but write the compressed
       output to a /tmp/ml85xxxxxxxx  file,  where  the  filename
       suffix  is the current time in time_t units (seconds since
       12/31/1970). The output file have the following structure:
       (1)  a  4  bytes header with the length in commands of the
       next block; (2) a block of n * 4 bytes, each group of four
       representing a data packet (see my articles at http://mem­
       bers.xoom.com/rpragana); (3) other sequences of  (1),  and
       (2).

       -r  toggle  the  reset  flag.  The default is to reset the
       printer before printing the given document.

       -t topskip shift the page image to the top  by  the  given
       pixel units. The default is 150. This is to compensate the
       shifted images created by ghostscript, with large top  and
       left margins. See also the leftskip adjustment below.

       -l  leftskip shift the page image to the left by the given
       pixel units.   The  default  is  120.  The  maximum  shift
       allowed here is 1600.

       -f  imagefile  print from a file instead of receiving from
       stdin. The file should be a pbmraw  image,  possibly  with
       several  pages  concatenated.  Image  files in this format
       (pbmraw) are very large and should be avoided,  by  piping
       ghostscript output directly to the printer driver.
