NAME
       install-fvwmgenmenu: don't use! It used to be for compati­
       bility with menu-methods that were over 2  year  old,  but
       that  compatibility  support has been removed now. So, now
       install-fvwmgenmenu is a  binary  that  calls  the  script
       install-fvwmgenmenu.sh,  that tells the user/system admin­
       istrator to update his/her menu-methods.

       Public License.  (GPL 2.0 or greater).
