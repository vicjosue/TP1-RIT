NAME
       splash, splac - a splash screen renderer

SYNOPSIS
       splash logo.xpm program-or-script

       splac title string

       splac image new.xpm

DESCRIPTION
       Splash renders splash screens for installers and other non
       GUI aware application code.  If invoked  from  a  non  X11
       environment  it  remains  silent but runs the client code.
       It displays the selected xpm images centered on  the  dis­
       play and shaped according to the mask of the xpm.  (If you
       want to no shape use no mask.)

       splash opens a window to display the image  gives  as  the
       first argument.  This must be a .xpm file.  Then it starts
       the script given as the second argument.

       splac should only be called from within this  script.   It
       accepts the following arguments:

       image  new.xpm Changes the image to new.xpm.

       title  string  Sets  the  window title to string.  The new
              image need not be the same size.
