NAME
       directomatic - Print without spooler

SYNOPSIS
       directomatic -P <printdef> [-J jobtitle]  [-o option=value
       [...]] [file]


DESCRIPTION
       Directomatic is a filter script to print with  free  soft­
       ware  printer drivers without the need of a print spooler.
       It is designed to be used together with a Foomatic printer
       definition file.


   Options
       -P <printdef>
                 where printdef is the printer definition file to
                 use.

       -J <jobtitle>
                 where job title will be printed in the head line
                 of every page of a plain text job.

       -o option=value
                 Set an arbitrary option.

       file      The file to print.



   Commands
       Directomatic  will print from standard input unless a file
       to print is  specified  on  the  command  line.   If  your
       printer  definition  file  is  in  /etc/foomatic/direct or
       ~/.foomatic/direct you do not need to  specify  its  path.
       Put a (instructions in the file) to redirect the output of
       directomatic to your printer instead of  standard  output.
       To  make  normal  users able to print this way add them to
       group lp and make sure the appropriate printer device file
       /dev/lpX is group-writable.

EXIT STATUS
       directomatic returns 0 unless  something  unexpected  hap­
       pens.
