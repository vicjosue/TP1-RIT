NAME
       pnmtops - convert portable anymap to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtops  [-scale s] [-dpi n] [-imagewidth n] [-imageheight
       n] [-width n] [-height n]  [-equalpixels]  [-turn|-noturn]
       [-rle|-runlength] [-center|-nocenter] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  Netpbm  image  as  input.  Produces Encapsulated
       PostScript as output.

       If the input file is in color (PPM), pnmtops  generates  a
       color PostScript file.  Some PostScript interpreters can't
       handle color PostScript.  If you have  one  of  these  you
       will need to run your image through ppmtopgm first.

       If  you specify no output dimensioning options, the output
       image is dimensioned such that  72  pixels  of  the  input
       image  generate  one inch of output image.  Except if that
       would exceed the default  page  size  (8.5  inches  by  11
       inches), the output image is shrunk enough to fit.

       Use   -imagewidth,   -imageheight,  -equalpixels,  -width,
       -height, and -scale to adjust that.



OPTIONS
       -imagewidth
              -imageheight Tells how wide and high you  want  the
              image  on the page, in inches.  The aspect ratio of
              the image is preserved, so if you specify  both  of
              these,  the  image  on the page will be the largest
              image that will fit within the box of those  dimen­
              sions.

              If these dimensions are greater than the page size,
              you get Postscript output that runs off the page.

              You  cannot  use  imagewidth  or  imageheight  with
              -scale or -equalpixels.


       -equalpixels
              This  option  causes  the  output image to have the
              same number of pixels as the input  image.   So  if
              the output is 600 dpi and your image is 3000 pixels
              wide, the output image would be 5 inches wide.

              You  cannot  use  -equalpixels  with   -imagewidth,
              -imageheight, or -scale.


       -scale tells  how big you want the image on the page.  The
              value is the number of inches of output image  that
              you want 72 pixels of the input to generate.

              If  the  size so specified does not fit on the page
              (as measured  either  by  the  -width  and  -height
              options  or  the default page size of 8.5 inches by
              11 inches), pnmtops  ignores  the  -scale  options,
              issues  a  warning,  and scales the image to fit on
              the page.


       -dpi   This option specifies the dots  per  inch  of  your
              output  device.  The default is 300 dpi.  In theory
              PostScript is device-independent and you don't have
              to  worry  about  this,  but in practice its raster
              rendering can have unsightly bands  if  the  device
              pixels and the image pixels aren't in sync.

              Also  this  option is crucial to the working of the
              equalpixels option.


       -width -height These options specify the dimensions of the
              page  on  which  the output is to be printed.  This
              affects the size of the output image.

              The page size has  no  effect,  however,  when  you
              specify    the    -imagewidth,   -imageheight,   or
              -equalpixels options.

              The default is 8.5 inches by 11 inches.


       -turn  -noturn These options  control  whether  the  image
              gets  turned  90 degrees.  Normally, if an image is
              wider than it is tall, it gets turned automatically
              to  better  fit the page.  If you specify the -turn
              option, pnmtops turns the image no matter what  its
              shape;  If  you  specify  -noturn, pnmtops does not
              turn it no matter what its shape.

       -rle   -runlength These  identical  options  specify  run-
              length  compression.   This  may  save  time if the
              host-to-printer link  is  slow;  but  normally  the
              printer's  processing time dominates, so -rle makes
              things slower.

       -center
              -nocenter By default, pnmtops centers the image  on
              the  output  page.  You can specify this explicitly
              with  the  -center  option,  or  cause  pnmtops  to
              instead put the image against the upper left corner
              of the page with the -nocenter option.  The  latter
              is useful for programs which can include PostScript
              files, but can't cope with pictures which  are  not
              positioned in the upper left corner.

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique
       prefix.
