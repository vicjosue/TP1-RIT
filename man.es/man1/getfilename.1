getfilename(1)                                     getfilename(1)



NAME
       getfilename  - Ask the user to name a file in a given for­
       mat

SYNOPSIS
       getfilename  format-name file-name

DESCRIPTION
       The getfilename program will ask the user for the name  of
       a file in the specified format, and will copy that file to
       the file-name given as the second argument.

       If this doesn't sound very useful by itself, you're right.
       However, this turns out to be all you need in order to add
       some useful  functionality  to  mailcap-oriented  programs
       such  as  mailto(1).  For example, the following line in a
       mailcap file  allows  mailto  to  help  the  user  include
       PostScript in outgoing mail:

       application/postscript   ;   lpr   -Pipa   %s  ;  descrip­
       tion="Include  a   Postscript   File";compose="getfilename
       Postscript %s"


SEE ALSO
       mailto(1), metamail(1)

BUGS
       This is such a tiny program it might actually be bug-free,
       but I wouldn't bet on it.
