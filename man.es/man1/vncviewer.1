NAME
       vncviewer - VNC client application

SYNOPSIS
       vncviewer [options] host:display#
       vncviewer [options] -listen [display#]

DESCRIPTION
       View  a  VNC session.  This is an Xt-based client applica­
       tion for the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) system.   You
       can  use  vncviewer to use a computing desktop environment
       that is running on a different machine.

       You can use F8 to display a pop-up utility menu.

OPTIONS
       The options are standard Xt options, or:

       -shared
              When connecting, specify that a  shared  connection
              is allowed.  This is the default.

       -noshared
              When  connecting,  specify that the session may not
              be shared.

       -viewonly
              Block mouse and keyboard events.

       -fullscreen
              Occupy the entire screen.

       -passwd passwd-file
              File from which to get the password  (as  generated
              by the vncpasswd(1) program).

       -encodings encoding-list
              A  list of encodings to use in order of preference,
              separated by  spaces.   The  default  is  "copyrect
              tight  hextile  zlib  corre  rre", or "raw copyrect
              tight hextile zlib corre rre" for a VNC  server  on
              the same machine.

       -bgr233
              Always  use  the BGR233 (8-bit) pixel format on the
              wire, regardless of the visual.

       -owncmap
              Try to use a PseudoColor visual and a private  col­
              ormap  -  this allows the VNC server to control the
              colormap.

       -truecolour
              Try to use a TrueColor visual.

       -depth depth
              Try to use a visual of this depth (bits per pixel).

       -compresslevel level
              Use  specified  compression  level  (0-9) for tight
              encoding.

       -quality level
              Use the specified image  quality  level  (0-9)  for
              tight encoding.

       -nocursorshape
              Disable the local cursor shape extension.
