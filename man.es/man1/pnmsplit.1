NAME
       pnmsplit - split a multi-image PNM file into multiple sin­
       gle-image files

SYNOPSIS
       pnmsplit [pnmfile[ output_file_pattern]]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Netpbm file as input.  Copies each  image  in  the
       input into a separate file, in the same format.

       pnmfile  is the file specification of the input file, or -
       to indicate  Standard  Input.   The  default  is  Standard
       Input.

       output_file_pattern  tells  how  to name the output files.
       It is the file specification of the  output  file,  except
       that  the first occurence of "%d" in it is replaced by the
       image sequence number in unpadded ASCII decimal, with  the
       sequence  starting  at 0.  If there is no "%d" in the pat­
       tern, pnmsplit fails.

       The default output file pattern is "image%d".

       Note that to do the reverse operation (combining  multiple
       single-image  PNM  files into a multi-image one), there is
       no special Netpbm program.  Just use cat.
