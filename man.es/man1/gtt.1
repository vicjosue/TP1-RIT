NAME
       gtt - GTimeTracker - a time tracker

SYNOPSIS
       gtt [--display displayname] [--geometry geometry]

DESCRIPTION
       GTimeTracker is a simple combination of a stopwatch, a to-
       do-list manager and time-keeping/billing system.

       In its simplest mode of operation, as a stopwatch, it sim­
       ply  counts  the number of elapsed seconds while the timer
       is running.  Unlike ordinary stopwatches, it will  keep  a
       log  of  each time that the timer was started and stopped.
       The log, or 'journal', can  be  annotated  with  comments,
       allowing a diary of events to be kept.

       GTimeTracker functions as a billing system by allowing you
       to assign a value to an hour's worth  of  time.   You  can
       specify  overtime,  double-overtime  rates and fixed flat-
       fees.  Individual chunks of time as 'billable',

       GTimeTracker can also be  used  as  a  simple  to-do  list
       tracker.   You  can assign an urgency as well as an impor­
       tance to a given project, assign an  estimated  start  and
       end  date,  specify a sizing and a percent-complete value.
       Clicking on column headings will  sort  the  list  in  the
       order of that column.

       Custom reports can be created using standard HTML enhanced
       with embedded Scheme (a LISP -like programming  language).


OPTIONS
       --display
              specifies  the X server that gtt should connect to.

       --geometry
              specifies the geometry of the main window. The syn­
              tax [WIDTHxHEIGHT][(+|-)X(+|-)Y] is just like the X
              toolkit option geometry.  See X(1x) for more  info.
