NAME
       gdialog - display dialog boxes from shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       gdialog --clear
       gdialog --create-rc file
       gdialog  [  --title  title  ]  [ --backtitle backtitle ] [
       --clear ] [ --separate-output ] box-options

DESCRIPTION
       Gdialog is a program that will let you to present a  vari­
       ety  of  questions  or display messages using dialog boxes
       from a shell script.  Currently,  these  types  of  dialog
       boxes are implemented:

       yes/no  box,  menu  box, input box, message box, text box,
       info box, checklist box,  radiolist  box  gauge  box,  and
       password box.

       This  program  is  much like the dialog program, but along
       with displaying textual dialog boxes  if  the  environment
       variable  DISPLAY is unset, if the environment variable is
       set it will instead display graphical dialog  boxes  using
       gtk/gnome.


OPTIONS
       --clear
              The  screen will be cleared to the screen attribute
              on exit.

       --create-rc file
              Since gdialog supports run-time configuration, this
              can  be used to dump a sample configuration file to
              the file specified by file.

       --separate-output
              For checklist widgets, output result one line at  a
              time, with no quoting.  This facilitates parsing by
              another program.

       --title title
              Specifies a title string to be displayed at the top
              of the dialog box.

       --backtitle backtitle
              Specifies a backtitle string to be displayed on the
              backdrop, at the top of the screen.

       Box Options

       --yesno text height width
              A yes/no dialog box of size height  rows  by  width
              columns  will be displayed. The string specified by
              text is displayed inside the dialog  box.  If  this
              string  is  too  long  to be fitted in one line, it
              will be automatically divided into  multiple  lines
              at  appropriate  places.  The  text string may also
              contain the sub-string "\n" or  newline  characters
              `\n'  to  control  line  breaking explicitly.  This
              dialog box is  useful  for  asking  questions  that
              require  the  user to answer either yes or no.  The
              dialog box has a Yes button and  a  No  button,  in
              which  the  user can switch between by pressing the
              TAB key.

       --msgbox text height width
              A message box is very similar to a yes/no box.  The
              only  difference between a message box and a yes/no
              box is that a message box has only a single OK but­
              ton.  You  can  use  this dialog box to display any
              message you like.  After reading the  message,  the
              user  can  press  the ENTER key so that dialog will
              exit and the calling shell script can continue  its
              operation.

       --infobox text height width
              An  info  box is basically a message box.  However,
              in this case, dialog will  exit  immediately  after
              displaying  the  message to the user. The screen is
              not cleared when dialog exits, so that the  message
              will  remain  on the screen until the calling shell
              script clears it later. This  is  useful  when  you
              want  to  inform  the user that some operations are
              carrying on that may require some time to finish.

       --inputbox text height width [init]
              An input box is useful when you want to  ask  ques­
              tions  that  require  the user to input a string as
              the answer. If init is supplied it is used to  ini­
              tialize   the  input  string.   When  inputing  the
              string, the BACKSPACE key can be  used  to  correct
              typing  errors.  If the input string is longer than
              can be fitted in the dialog box,  the  input  field
              will be scrolled. On exit, the input string will be
              printed on stderr.

       --passwordbox text height width [init]
              A password box is similar to an input  box,  except
              the  text the user enters is not displayed. This is
              useful when prompting for passwords or other sensi­
              tive  information.  Be  aware  that  if anything is
              passed in "init", it will be visible  in  the  sys­
              tem's process table to casual snoopers. Also, it is
              very confusing to the user to provide them  with  a
              default  password  they  cannot see. For these rea­
              sons, using "init" is highly discouraged.

       --textbox file height width
              A text box lets you display the contents of a  text
              file in a dialog box. It is like a simple text file
              viewer. The user can move through the file by using
              the  UP/DOWN, PGUP/PGDN and HOME/END keys available
              on most keyboards.  If the lines are too long to be
              displayed  in  the  box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be
              used to scroll the text  region  horizontally.  For
              more  convenience,  forward  and backward searching
              functions are also provided.

       --menu text height width menu-height [ tag item ] ...
              As its name suggests, a menu box is  a  dialog  box
              that  can  be  used to present a list of choices in
              the form of a menu for the  user  to  choose.  Each
              menu  entry  consists  of  a tag string and an item
              string. The tag gives the entry a name  to  distin­
              guish  it  from  the other entries in the menu. The
              item is a short description of the option that  the
              entry  represents.  The  user  can move between the
              menu entries by  pressing  the  UP/DOWN  keys,  the
              first letter of the tag as a hot-key, or the number
              keys 1-9. There are menu-height  entries  displayed
              in  the  menu  at  one  time,  but the menu will be
              scrolled if there are more entries than that.  When
              dialog exits, the tag of the chosen menu entry will
              be printed on stderr.

       --checklist text height width list-height [ tag item  sta­
       tus ] ...
              A checklist box is similar to a menu  box  in  that
              there are multiple entries presented in the form of
              a menu. Instead of choosing  one  entry  among  the
              entries,  each entry can be turned on or off by the
              user. The initial on/off state  of  each  entry  is
              specified  by  status.   On exit, a list of the tag
              strings of those entries that are turned on will be
              printed on stderr.


       --radiolist text height width list-height  [ tag item sta­
       tus ] ...
              A radiolist box is similar to a menu box.  The only
              difference is that you can indicate which entry  is
              currently selected, by setting its status to on.


       --gauge text height width percent
              A  gauge  box  displays a meter along the bottom of
              the box.  The meter indicates the percentage.   New
              percentages are read from standard input, one inte­
              ger per line.  The meter is updated to reflect each
              new  percentage.   If stdin is XXX, then subsequent
              lines up to another XXX are used for a new  prompt.
              The gauge exits when EOF is reached on stdin.


RUN-TIME CONFIGURATION
       1.  Create a sample configuration file by typing:

                 "dialog --create-rc <file>"

       2.  At  start,  dialog  determines  the settings to use as
           follows:

           a)  if environment  variable  DIALOGRC  is  set,  it's
               value  determines  the  name  of the configuration
               file.

           b)  if the file in (a) can't be found,  use  the  file
               $HOME/.dialogrc as the configuration file.

           c)  if the file in (b) can't be found, use compiled in
               defaults.

       3.  Edit the sample configuration file and copy it to some
           place that dialog can find, as stated in step 2 above.

ENVIROMENT
       DIALOGRC       Define this variable if you want to specify
                      the  name of the configuration file to use.

FILES
       $HOME/.dialogrc     default configuration file

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if dialog is exited by pressing  the  Yes
       or OK button, and 1 if the No or Cancel button is pressed.
       Otherwise, if errors occur  inside  dialog  or  dialog  is
       exited by pressing the ESC key, the exit status is -1.

BUGS
       Text  files  containing  tab characters may cause problems
       with text box.  Tab characters in text files must first be
       expanded to spaces before being displayed by text box.

       Screen update is too slow.
