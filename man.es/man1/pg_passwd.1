NAME
       pg_passwd - change a secondary PostgreSQL password file

SYNOPSIS
       pg_passwd filename

DESCRIPTION
       pg_passwd  is  a  tool for manipulating flat text password
       files. These files can control  client  authentication  of
       the  PostgreSQL  server. More information about setting up
       this authentication mechanism can be found in the Adminis­
       trator's Guide.

       The  format of a text password file is one entry per line;
       the fields of each entry  are  separated  by  colons.  The
       first  field  is  the  user  name, the second field is the
       encrypted password. Other fields  are  ignored  (to  allow
       password  files to be shared between applications that use
       similar formats). pg_passwd enables users to interactively
       add entries to such a file, to alter passwords of existing
       entries, and to encrypt such passwords.

       Supply the name of the password file as  argument  to  the
       pg_passwd  command.  To  be  used  by PostgreSQL, the file
       needs to be located in the server's  data  directory,  and
       the  base  name  of  the file needs to be specified in the
       pg_hba.conf access control file.

       $ pg_passwd /usr/local/pgsql/data/passwords
       File "/usr/local/pgsql/data/passwords" does not exist.  Create? (y/n): y
       Username: guest
       Password:
       Re-enter password:

       where the Password: and Re-enter password: prompts require
       the same password input which is not displayed on the ter­
       minal. Note that the password is limited to  eight  useful
       characters   by  restrictions  of  the  standard  crypt(3)
       library routine.

       The original password file is renamed to passwords.bk.

       To make use of this password file, put  a  line  like  the
       following in pg_hba.conf:

       host  mydb     133.65.96.250   255.255.255.255 password passwords

       which  would  allow  access  to  database  mydb  from host
       133.65.96.250 using the passwords listed in the  passwords
       file (and only to the users listed in that file).

              Note:  It is also useful to have entries in a pass­
              word file with empty password fields. (This is dif­
              ferent  from an empty password.) Such entries allow
              you to restrict users who can  access  the  system.
              These  entries  cannot be managed by pg_passwd, but
              you can edit password files manually.
