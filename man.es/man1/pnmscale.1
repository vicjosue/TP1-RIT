DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input, scales it by  the
       specified  factor  or  factors  and  produces a PGM or PPM
       image as output.  If the input file is in color (PPM), the
       output  will be too, otherwise it will be grayscale (PGM).
       This is true even if the input is a black and white bitmap
       (PBM),  because the process of scaling can turn a combina­
       tion of black and white pixels into a gray pixel.

       If you want PBM output, use pgmtopbm to convert pnmscale's
       output to PBM.  Also consider pbmreduce.

       You  can both enlarge (scale factor > 1) and reduce (scale
       factor < 1).

       When you specify an absolute size or scale factor for both
       dimensions,  pnmscale  scales each dimension independently
       without consideration of the aspect ratio.

       If you specify one dimension as a  pixel  size  and  don't
       specify  the other dimension, pnmscale scales the unspeci­
       fied dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.

       If you specify one dimension as a scale factor  and  don't
       specify  the other dimension, pnmscale leaves the unspeci­
       fied dimension unchanged from the input.

       If you  specify  the  scale_factor  parameter  instead  of
       dimension  options,  that  is  the  scale  factor for both
       dimensions.   It  is  equivalent  to  -xscale=scale_factor
       -yscale=scale_factor .

       Specifying  the -reduce reduction_factor option is equiva­
       lent  to  specifying  the  scale_factor  parameter,  where
       scale_factor is the reciprocal of reduction_factor.

       -xysize  specifies  a  bounding  box.  pnmscale scales the
       input image to the largest size that fits within the  box,
       while preserving its aspect ratio.

       -pixels specifies a maximum total number of output pixels.
       pnmscale scales the image down to that number  of  pixels.
       If  the input image is already no more than that many pix­
       els, pnmscale just copies it as output; pnmscale does  not
       scale up with -pixels.

       If you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should proba­
       bly add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the orig­
       inal pixels in the resulting image.


   PRECISION
       pnmscale uses floating point arithmetic internally.  There
       is a speed cost associated with this.   For  some  images,
       you  can  get  the  acceptable results (in fact, sometimes
       identical results) faster with pnmscalefixed,  which  uses
       fixed  point arithmetic.  pnmscalefixed may, however, dis­
       tort your image a little.  See  pnmscalefixed's  man  page
       for a complete discussion of the difference.
