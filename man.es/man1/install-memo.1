DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the small application install-
       memo.  install-memo allows the user to write one  or  more
       files  as  a new memo or memos, respectively, on the Pilot
       connected to the specified callout device.  Once  install-
       memo  is started, the user must invoke HotSync on the tar­
       get device.

              Normally  install-memo  uses Unfiled as the default
              category.

       -q     Causes install-memo to be quiet and not prompt  you
              to press the HotSync button.

       -r     Replace  all memos in the category specified by the
              -c category option.

       -t     Use the filename as the title for  the  memo.  (The
              title is the first line of a memo.)

       The  program  will connect to a target, and write the file
       or files given on the command line.

BUGS
       The Palm Device may have a maximum length on memo sizes.
