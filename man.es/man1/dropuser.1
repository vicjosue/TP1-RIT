DROPUSER(1)       PostgreSQL Client Applications      DROPUSER(1)



NAME
       dropuser - remove a PostgreSQL user account

SYNOPSIS
       dropuser [ options... ] [ username ]

   INPUTS
       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server is running. If host begins with a slash,  it
              is  used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port  or  local  Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -e, --echo
              Echo the queries that createdb generates and  sends
              to the server.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display a response.

       -i, --interactive
              Prompt  for  confirmation  before actually removing
              the user.

       username
              Specifies the name of the  PostgreSQL  user  to  be
              removed.   This  name  must exist in the PostgreSQL
              installation.  You will be prompted for a  name  if
              none is specified on the command line.


       The  options  -h,  -p,  and -e, are passed on literally to
       psql(1). The psql options -U and -W are available as well,
       but they can be confusing in this context.

   OUTPUTS
       DROP USER
              All is well.

       dropuser: deletion of user "username" failed
              Something went wrong. The user was not removed.

       If  there is an error condition, the backend error message
       will be  displayed.   See  DROP  USER  [drop_user(7)]  and
       psql(1) for possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       dropuser  removes  an  existing  PostgreSQL  user  and the
       databases which that user owned.  Only users with usesuper
       set in the pg_shadow table can destroy PostgreSQL users.

       dropuser  is a shell script wrapper around the SQL command
       DROP USER [drop_user(7)] via  the  PostgreSQL  interactive
       terminal  psql(1).  Thus,  there  is nothing special about
       removing users via this or other methods. This means  that
       the  psql  must be found by the script and that a database
       server is running at the targeted host. Also, any  default
       settings  and  environment variables available to psql and
       the libpq front-end library do apply.

USAGE
       To remove user joe from the default database server:

       $ dropuser joe
       DROP USER



       To remove user joe using the postmaster on host eden, port
       5000,  with  verification  and  a  peek  at the underlying
       query:

       $ dropuser -p 5000 -h eden -i -e joe
       User "joe" and any owned databases will be permanently deleted.
       Are you sure? (y/n) y
       DROP USER "joe"
       DROP USER
