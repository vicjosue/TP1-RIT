NAME
       autom4te - Generate files and scripts thanks to M4

SYNOPSIS
       autom4te [OPTION] ... [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  GNU M4 on the FILES, avoiding useless runs.  If trac­
       ing, the output consists of  the  traces  only,  otherwise
       output the expansion of the FILES.  The first of the FILES
       may be an M4 frozen file, but then  must  end  in  `.m4f'.
       Some  files  may be optional, i.e., will only be processed
       if found in the include path, but then must end in `.m4?';
       the question mark is not part of the actual file name.
