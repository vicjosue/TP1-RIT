NAME
       pnmtotiff - convert a PNM image to a TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtotiff   [-none|-packbits|-lzw|-g3|-g4]  [-2d]  [-fill]
       [-predictor  n]  [-msb2lsb|-lsb2msb]   [-rowsperstrip   n]
       [-minisblack] [pnmfile]

       Minimum  unambiguous  abbreviations of options are accept­
       able.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PNM image as input.  Produces a TIFF file as  out­
       put.

       The  output goes to Standard Output, which must be a seek­
       able file.  That means no  pipes,  but  any  regular  file
       should work.



OPTIONS
       By default, pnmtotiff creates a TIFF file with no compres­
       sion.  This is your best bet most of  the  time.   If  you
       want  to  try  another compression scheme or tweak some of
       the other even more obscure output options,  there  are  a
       number of flags to play with.

       Actually,  the  best  default would be to use LZW compres­
       sion, which is what pnmtotiff used to do by default.  How­
       ever,  the Tiff library no longer does LZW compression due
       to concerns with violating Unisys's patent on LZW compres­
       sion.

       The  -none, -packbits, -lzw, -g3, and -g4 options are used
       to override the default and  set  the  compression  scheme
       used  in  creating the output file.  The CCITT Group 3 and
       Group 4 compression  algorithms  can  only  be  used  with
       bilevel  data.   -lzw doesn't really work because the Tiff
       library doesn't do LZW compression.  It used to,  but  its
       developers  removed the function out of concern about vio­
       lating Unisys's patent.  This option remains in  case  you
       use  a Tiff library that cooperates, now or in the future.
       The -2d and -fill options are meaningful only with Group 3
       compression:  -2d  requests  2-dimensional encoding, while
       -fill requests that each encoded scanline  be  zero-filled
       to a byte boundry.  The -predictor option is only meaning­
       ful with LZW compression: a predictor value  of  2  causes
       each  scanline  of  the output image to undergo horizontal
       differencing before it is encoded; a  value  of  1  forces
       each scanline to be encoded without differencing.

       By  default, pnmtotiff creates a TIFF file with msb-to-lsb
       fill order.  The -msb2lsb and -lsb2msb options are used to
       override the default and set the fill order used in creat­
       ing the file.

       The fill order is the order in  which  pixels  are  packed
       into a byte in the Tiff raster, in the case that there are
       multiple pixels per byte.  msb-to-lsb means that the left­
       most columns go into the most significant bits of the byte
       in the Tiff image.  However, there is considerable  confu­
       sion  about  the  meaning  of fill order.  Some believe it
       means whether 16 bit sample values in the Tiff  image  are
       little-endian  or  big-endian.   This is totally erroneous
       (The endianness of integers in a Tiff image is  designated
       by  the  image's  magic number).  However, ImageMagick and
       Netpbm both have been known to implement that  interpreta­
       tion.  2001.09.06.

       If  the image does not have sub-byte pixels, these options
       have no effect other than to set the  value  of  the  FIL­
       LORDER  tag  in  the  Tiff  image (which may be useful for
       those programs that misinterpret the tag with reference to
       16 bit samples).


       The  -rowsperstrip option can be used to set the number of
       rows (scanlines) in each strip of data in the output file.
       By  default,  the  output  file has the number of rows per
       strip set to a value that will ensure  each  strip  is  no
       more than 8 kilobytes long.

       The  -minisblack  option forces the output image to have a
       "minimum is black" photometric even when using Group 3  or
       Group 4 compression, in which case CCITT fax standards say
       the proper photometric is "minimum is white."

       Without the  -minisblack  option,  pnmtotiff  follows  the
       standard.   This usually results in better compression and
       is generally preferred for bilevel coding.

       Before February 2001, pnmtotiff always  produced  "minimum
       is  black,"  due to a bug.  In either case, pnmtotiff sets
       the photometric interpretation  tag  in  the  TIFF  output
       according to which photometric is actually used.


NOTES
       There  are  myriad variations of the TIFF format, and this
       program generates only a few of them.  pnmtotiff creates a
       grayscale  TIFF file if its input is a PBM (monochrome) or
       PGM (grayscale) file.  pnmtotiff also creates a  grayscale
       file  if  it  input  is PPM (color), but there is only one
       color in the image.  If the input is a  PPM  (color)  file
       and there are 256 colors or fewer, but more than 1, pnmto­
       tiff generates a color palette TIFF file.   If  there  are
       more  colors  than  that,  pnmtotiff generates an RGB (not
       RGBA) single plane TIFF file.  Use pnmtotiffcmyk to gener­
       ate  the  cyan-magenta-yellow-black  ink  color separation
       TIFF format.

       The number of bits per sample in the TIFF output is deter­
       mined  by  the  maxval of the PNM input.  If the maxval is
       less than 256, the bits per sample in the  output  is  the
       smallest number that can encode the maxval.  If the maxval
       is greater than or equal to 256, there  are  16  bits  per
       sample in the output.
