NAME
     aumix - adjust audio mixer

SYNOPSIS
     aumix [-<channel
           option>[[+|-][<amount>]]|<level>|R[ecord]|P[lay]|q[uery]] [-dhILqS]
           [-f <rc file>][-C <color scheme file>]

DESCRIPTION
     This program adjusts the settings of an audio mixing device.  It can be
     used from the command line, in scripts, or interactively with the key­
     board or mouse.

OPTIONS
   CHANNEL OPTIONS
     -v          main volume
     -b          bass
     -c          CD
     -i          line in
     -l          line
     -m          microphone
     -o          line out
     -p          PC speaker
     -s          synthesizer
     -t          treble
     -w          PCM
     -x          imix
     -1          line 1
     -2          line 2
     -3          line 3

     For each channel, q queries, + and - increment and decrement by one, or
     an amount if one is specified.  If no + or - is given after the channel
     option, a number sets a specific level (monophonically).

   OTHER OPTIONS

     -C color_scheme_file
                 specify the name of a file containing a color scheme.  This
                 implies -I.

     -d device_file
                 specify the name of the mixer device (default is /dev/mixer)

     -f rc_file  specify file for saving and loading settings

     -h          display information on usage

     -I          run aumix interactively, using the full-screen ncurses-based
                 interface.  This is the default if no options are given, but
                 must be specified in order to have aumix go into interactive
                 mode after doing things non-interactively.

     -L          load settings from $HOME/.aumixrc, or /etc/aumixrc if the
                 former is inaccessible

     -q          query all devices and print their settings

     -S          save settings to $HOME/.aumixrc

EXAMPLES
     The command

           aumix -q -v75 -m 0 -c R -c+10 -m q

     prints all settings, sets volume to 75%, sets microphone to 0, sets CD to
     record, increases the CD level by ten (both left and right), and prints
     the new settings for the microphone.

     The .aumixrc file containing:

           vol:60:60
           wait:5000
           vol:50:50

     sets the volume to 60%, waits five seconds, then reduces the volume to
     50%.  Note that "wait" lines will not be saved by aumix.  They must be
     added by hand.

INTERACTIVE USE
     If no options are given on the command line, and aumix is compiled with
     ncurses, it will run interactively.

   LAYOUT
     The left bank of controls is used for adjusting levels; the right bank is
     for adjusting balance.  Mixing channels not supported by your hardware
     will not be shown.  Mixing channels which are stereo-capable will have
     balance controls.

   KEYS
     The following keys control aumix in interactive mode:

     page up, page down, up and down cursor
                 select a new control.

     Tab, Enter, <, >, comma and period
                 toggle between level and balance controls

     +, -, [, ], left and right cursor and digits
                 adjust the setting of the current device.  The + and right
                 cursor keys increase the level by 3%; the - and left cursor
                 keys decrease it by the same amount.  The [ key sets it to 0%
                 and ] sets it to 100%.  The digits 1 to 9 set it to 10%
                 through 90%.  The same keys work analogously on the balance
                 controls.

     Space       toggles between record and play for controls which are capa­
                 ble of this.

     |           centers the balance of the current device.

     K or k      show a description of the functions of keys

     L or l      load settings from $HOME/.aumixrc, falling back to
                 /etc/aumixrc

     M or m      mute or unmute

     O or o      ``only'': mute all channels but the current one

     S or s      save settings to the rc file

     U or u      undo any muting

     Q or q      end the program

     ^L          refresh screen

     ^Z, ^D and ^C also have their normal function (the screen is refreshed
     when aumix is brought to the foreground).

   MOUSE
     In interactive mode, aumix can accept input from the mouse if gpm(8) is
     running and aumix is compiled with gpm(8) support.  If gpm is not running
     but gpm support is included, the message `mouse off' will appear at the
     top of the screen, and only keyboard input will be accepted.  With gpm(8)
     running, most functions can be performed through the mouse.  The mouse is
     active whenever one of its buttons is held down.  While active, it works
     in the following ways:
     ·   over a control track, it sets the control to match the position of
         the mouse cursor.
     ·   over a record/play indicator, it toggles the record/play state.
     ·   over the `Quit', `Load', `Save', `Keys', `Mute', `Only', or `Undo'
         labels at the top of the screen, it causes those actions to take
         place.

ENVIRONMENT
     The HOME variable is used.  When aumix is compiled with GTK+ support,
     DISPLAY is checked, and if set is used.  LANG is used when aumix the
     ncurses screen is displayed.

FILES
     Saved settings for the mixer are kept in the /etc/aumixrc and
     $HOME/.aumixrc files, but can be kept anywhere if specified explicitly.
     Color schemes are normally kept in the directory given by DATADIR at com­
     pilation time, but are preferentially loaded from the current directory
     and can be kept anywhere so long as the path to them is specified.  The
     format of these files is:

           item foreground background

     where item is one of `active', `axis', `handle', `menu', `play',
     `record', or `track' and foreground and background are one of `black',
     `red', `green', `yellow', `blue', `magenta', `cyan', or `white'.  The
     words should be separated by whitespace and can be upper-, lower-, or
     mixed-case.  Lines not matching all these conditions are ignored.  Some
     samples of color schemes are provided, named after the sort of terminal
     where they should be most suitable.

     If either foreground or background is given as `-', then the default
     color for that is used.  The defaults are a white foreground and black
     background.

     An xpm icon is provided.

VERSION
     This page corresponds to version 2.7.

BUGS
     Suspending with ^Z may make the terminal difficult to use.

     Information such as the version of aumix, the architecture and operating
     system, and the model of sound hardware is sometimes needed to diagnose
     problems, so it is best if you include such details in any bug reports.
