NAME
       hpftodit  -  create  font  description  files for use with
       groff -Tlj4

SYNOPSIS
       hpftodit [ -sv ] [ -in ] tfm_file map_file font

       It is possible to have whitespace between the  -i  command
       line option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       hpftodit creates a font file for use with groff -Tlj4 from
       an HP tagged font metric file.  tfm_file is  the  name  of
       the  tagged  font metric file for the font.  map_file is a
       file giving the groff names for characters  in  the  font;
       this  file  should  consist  of a sequence of lines of the
       form:

              n c1 c2 ...

       where n is a decimal integer giving the MSL number of  the
       character,  and  c1,  c2,...   are  the groff names of the
       character.  font is the name of the groff font file.   The
       groff font file is written to font.

       The  -s  option  should be given if the font is special (a
       font is special if troff should search it whenever a char­
       acter  is  not found in the current font.)  If the font is
       special, it should be listed in the fonts command  in  the
       DESC  file; if it is not special, there is no need to list
       it, since troff can automatically mount it when it's first
       used.

       If the -i option is used, hpftodit will automatically gen­
       erate an italic correction, a left italic correction and a
       subscript  correction for each character (the significance
       of these parameters is explained in groff_font(5)).

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -s     The font is special.  The effect of this option  is
              to add the special command to the font file.

       -in    Generate an italic correction for each character so
              that the character's  width  plus  the  character's
              italic  correction  is equal to n design units plus
              the amount by which the right edge of  the  charac­
              ter's  bounding  is to the right of the character's
              origin.  If this would result in a negative  italic
              correction,  use  a zero italic correction instead.
              There are 8782 design units per em for  Intellifont
              fonts.

              Also  generate  a subscript correction equal to the
              product of the tangent of the slant of the font and
              four  fifths  of the x-height of the font.  If this
              would result in a subscript correction greater than
              the  italic  correction, use a subscript correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also generate a left  italic  correction  for  each
              character  equal  to n design units plus the amount
              by which the left edge of the character's  bounding
              box  is to the left of the character's origin.  The
              left italic correction may be negative.

              This option is normally needed only with italic (or
              oblique) fonts.

FILES
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devlj4/DESC
              Device description file.

       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devlj4/F
              Font description file for font F.

BUGS
       This  program was written without the benefit of complete,
       official documentation on the tagged font  metric  format.
       It  is  therefore  likely that it will fail to work on tfm
       files that are dissimilar to those for the internal  fonts
       on the Laserjet 4, with which it was tested:

       TrueType tfm files are not supported.
