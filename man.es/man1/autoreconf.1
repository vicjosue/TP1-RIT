NAME
       autoreconf - Update generated configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       autoreconf [OPTION] ... [TEMPLATE-FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Run    `autoconf'   (and   `autoheader',   `aclocal'   and
       `automake', where appropriate) repeatedly  to  remake  the
       Autoconf `configure' scripts and configuration header tem­
       plates in the directory tree rooted at the current  direc­
       tory.   By  default,  it only remakes those files that are
       older than their predecessors.  If you install a new  ver­
       sion  of Autoconf, running `autoreconf' remakes all of the
       files by giving it the `--force' option.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -v, --verbose
              verbosely report processing

       -d, --debug
              don't remove temporary files

       -f, --force
              consider all the files are obsolete

       -i, --install
              copy missing auxiliary files

       -s, --symlink
              instead of copying, install symbolic links

       The option `--install' is similar to  the  option  `--add-
       missing' in other tools.

   Library directories:
       -A, --autoconf-dir=ACDIR
              Autoconf's macro files location (rarely needed)

       -l, --localdir=DIR
              location of `aclocal.m4' and `acconfig.h'

       -M, --m4dir=M4DIR
              this package's Autoconf extensions

       Unless  specified,  heuristics try to compute `M4DIR' from
       the `Makefile.am', or defaults to `m4' if it exists.

   The following options are passed to `automake':
       --cygnus
              assume program is part of Cygnus-style tree

       --foreign
              set strictness to foreign

       --gnits
              set strictness to gnits

       --gnu  set strictness to gnu

       --include-deps
              include generated dependencies in Makefile.in

       The environment variables AUTOCONF, AUTOHEADER,  AUTOMAKE,
       and ACLOCAL are honored.
