DESCRIPTION
       pg_ctl is a utility for starting, stopping, or  restarting
       postmaster(1),  the PostgreSQL backend server, or display­
       ing the status of a running postmaster. Although the post­
       master  can  be started manually, pg_ctl encapulates tasks
       such as redirecting log output,  properly  detaching  from
       the terminal and process group, and it provides convenient
       options for controlled shutdown.

       In start mode, a new postmaster is launched. The server is
       started  in the background, the standard input attached to
       /dev/null. The standard  output  and  standard  error  are
       either  appended  to a log file, if the -l option is used,
       or are redirected to pg_ctl's standard output  (not  stan­
       dard error). If no log file is chosen, the standard output
       of pg_ctl should be redirected  to  a  file  or  piped  to
       another  process, for example a log rotating program, oth­
       erwise the postmaster will write its output the  the  con­
       trolling terminal (from the background) and will not leave
       the shell's process group.

       In stop mode, the postmaster that is running in the speci­
       fied data directory is shut down. Three different shutdown
       methods can be selected with the -m option: ``Smart'' mode
       waits  for  all  the  clients  to  disconnect. This is the
       default. ``Fast'' mode does not wait for clients  to  dis­
       connect.  All  active  transactions  are  rolled  back and
       clients are forcibly disconnected, then  the  database  is
       shut  down.  ``Immediate'' mode will abort all server pro­
       cesses without clean shutdown. This will lead to a  recov­
       ery run on restart.

       restart  mode  effectively  executes  a stop followed by a
       start. This allows the changing of postmaster command line
       options.

       reload  mode  simply sends the postmaster a SIGHUP signal,
       causing  it  to  reread  its  configuration  files  (post­
       gresql.conf,  pg_hba.conf,  etc.). This allows changing of
       configuration-file options that do not require a  complete
       restart to take effect.

       status  mode checks whether a postmaster is running and if
       so displays the PID and the command line options that were
       used to invoke it.

   OPTIONS
       -D datadir
              Specifies  the file system location of the database
              files. If this is omitted, the environment variable
              PGDATA is used.

       -l filename
              Append  the  server  log output to filename. If the
              file does not exist, it is created.  The  umask  is
              set  to  077,  so access to the log file from other
              users is disallowed by default.

       -m mode
              Specifies the shutdown mode.  mode  may  be  smart,
              fast,  or  immediate, or the first letter of one of
              these three.

       -o options
              Specifies options to be passed directly to postmas­
              ter.

              The  parameters are usually surrounded by single or
              double  quotes  to  ensure  that  they  are  passed
              through as a group.

       -p path
              Specifies  the  location  of  the  postmaster  exe­
              cutable. By default the postmaster  is  taken  from
              the  same directory as pg_ctl, or failing that, the
              hard-wired installation directory. It is not neces­
              sary  to use this option unless you are doing some­
              thing unusual and get errors  that  the  postmaster
              was not found.

       -s     Only print errors, no informational messages.

       -w     Wait  for  the start or shutdown to complete. Times
              out after 60 seconds. This is the default for shut­
              downs.

       -W     Do not wait for start or shutdown to complete. This
              is the default for starts and restarts.


   FILES
       If the file postmaster.opts.default  exists  in  the  data
       directory,  the  contents  of  the  file will be passed as
       options to the postmaster, unless  overridden  by  the  -o
       option.

EXAMPLES
   STARTING THE POSTMASTER
       To start up a postmaster:

       $ pg_ctl start


       An  example of starting the postmaster, blocking until the
       postmaster comes up is:

       $ pg_ctl -w start


       For a postmaster using  port  5433,  and  running  without
       fsync, use:

       $ pg_ctl -o "-F -p 5433" start


   STOPPING THE POSTMASTER
       $ pg_ctl stop

       stops  the  postmaster.  Using the -m switch allows one to
       control how the backend shuts down.

   RESTARTING THE POSTMASTER
       This is almost equivalent to stopping the  postmaster  and
       starting  it again except that pg_ctl saves and reuses the
       command line options that were passed  to  the  previously
       running  instance.  To  restart the postmaster in the sim­
       plest form:

       $ pg_ctl restart


       To restart postmaster, waiting for it to shut down and  to
       come up:

       $ pg_ctl -w restart


       To  restart  using  port  5433  and  disabling fsync after
       restarting:

       $ pg_ctl -o "-F -p 5433" restart


   SHOWING POSTMASTER STATUS
       Here is a sample status output from pg_ctl:

       $ pg_ctl status
       pg_ctl: postmaster is running (pid: 13718)
       Command line was:
       /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster '-D' '/usr/local/pgsql/data' '-p' '5433' '-B' '128'

       This is the command line that would be invoked in  restart
       mode.

BUGS
       Waiting for complete start is not a well-defined operation
       and may fail if access control is set up so that  a  local
       client  cannot  connect  without  manual  interaction.  It
       should be avoided.
