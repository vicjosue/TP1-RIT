       This program can be used to mirror a document from a WWW
       server.  The document is only transfered if the remote
       copy is newer than the local copy.  If the local copy is
       newer nothing happens.

       Use the "-v" option to print the version number of this
       program.

       The timeout value specified with the "-t" option.  The
       timeout value is the time that the program will wait for
       response from the remote server before it fails.  The
       default unit for the timeout value is seconds.  You might
       append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make it minutes
       or hours, repectively.

       Because this program is implemented using the LWP library,
       it only supports the protocols that LWP supports.
