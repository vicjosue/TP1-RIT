LOGGER(1)               System General Commands Manual               LOGGER(1)

NAME
     logger - make entries in the system log

SYNOPSIS
     logger [-isd] [-f file] [-p pri] [-t tag] [-u socket] [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Logger provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log
     module.

     Options:

     -i       Log the process id of the logger process with each line.

     -s       Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.

     -f file  Log the specified file.

     -p pri   Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may
              be specified numerically or as a ``facility.level'' pair.  For
              example, ``-p local3.info'' logs the message(s) as informational
              level in the local3 facility.  The default is ``user.notice.''

     -t tag   Mark every line in the log with the specified tag.

     -u sock  Write to socket as specified with socket instead of builtin sys­
              log routines.

     -d       Use a datagram instead of a stream connection to this socket.

     --       End the argument list. This is to allow the message to start
              with a hyphen (-).

     message  Write the message to log; if not specified, and the -f flag is
              not provided, standard input is logged.

     The logger utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Valid facility names are: auth, authpriv (for security information of a
     sensitive nature), cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail, news, security
     (deprecated synonym for auth), syslog, user, uucp, and local0 to local7,
     inclusive.

     Valid level names are): alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, error (deprecated
     synonym for err), info, notice, panic (deprecated synonym for emerg),
     warning, warn (deprecated synonym for warning).  For the priority order
     and intended purposes of these levels, see syslog(3).

EXAMPLES
           logger System rebooted

           logger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc

SEE ALSO

STANDARDS
     The logger command is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') com­
     patible.
