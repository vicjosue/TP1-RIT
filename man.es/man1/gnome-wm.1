gnome-wm  -  Launches  the  user  selected window manager for the
GNOME session

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-wm [--default-wm windowmanager] [--sm-client-id id]

DESCRIPTION
       The gnome-wm script invokes the user selected window  man­
       ager.  If the user has not chosen a window manager it will
       try to launch a GNOME compliant window manager.

       The user can overwrite the selection of a  window  manager
       by  setting the WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable.  If a
       --default-wm option is given the script uses  that  window
       manager in case WINDOW_MANAGER is not set.  If gnome-wm is
       given as the argument to --default-wm then it is the  same
       as if no default was given.

       The  script  takes  the --sm-client-id argument and trans­
       lates the id to an appropriate option depending  on  which
       window manager was selected.



ENVIRONMENT
       The  gnome-wm program uses the value of the WINDOW_MANAGER
       environment variable to let the user override the  config­
       ured window manager.

FILES
       The  program stores the current selection of a window man­
       ager in the ~/.gnome/default.wm file, this  file  has  the
       following format:

       [Default]
       WM=path-to-wm
