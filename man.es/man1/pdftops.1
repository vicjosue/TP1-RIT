NAME
       pdftops  -  Portable  Document  Format (PDF) to PostScript
       converter (version 1.00)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftops [options] [PDF-file [PS-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF)  files  to
       PostScript so they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the  PDF  file,  PDF-file,  and  writes  a
       PostScript file, PS-file.  If PS-file  is  not  specified,
       pdftops converts file.pdf to file.ps (or file.eps with the
       -eps option).  If PS-file is '-', the PostScript  is  sent
       to stdout.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdftops  reads  a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /etc/xpdfrc  (but  this  location  can  be
       changed  when  pdftops  is  built).  See the xpdfrc(5) man
       page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many of the following options can be set  with  configura­
       tion  file  commands.  These are listed in square brackets
       with the description of  the  corresponding  command  line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -level1
              Generate   Level   1   PostScript.   The  resulting
              PostScript files will be significantly  larger  (if
              they  contain  images),  but  will print on Level 1
              printers.  This also converts all images  to  black
              and  white.   The  default  behavior is to generate
              Level 2 PostScript.  In particular,  Level  2  sup­
              ports  color images and image compression.  No more
              than one of the PostScript level options  (-level1,
              -level1sep,  -level2sep)  may  be  given.   [config
              file: psLevel]

       -level1sep
              Generate Level 1 separable PostScript.  All  colors
              are  converted  to  CMYK.   Images are written with
              separate  stream  data  for  the  four  components.
              [config file: psLevel]

       -level2sep
              Generate  Level 2 separable PostScript.  All colors
              are converted to CMYK.  The  PostScript  separation
              convention  operators  are  used  to  handle custom
              (spot) colors.  [config file: psLevel]

       -eps   Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An
              EPS  file  contains  a  single image, so if you use
              this option with a multi-page PDF  file,  you  must
              use  -f  and  -l to specify a single page.  No more
              than one of the mode options (-eps, -form)  may  be
              given.

       -form  Generate a PostScript form which can be imported by
              software that understands forms.  A form contains a
              single  page,  so  if  you  use  this option with a
              multi-page PDF file, you must  use  -f  and  -l  to
              specify  a  single page.  The -level1 option cannot
              be used with -form.

       -opi   Generate OPI comments  for  all  images  and  forms
              which  have  OPI information.  (This option is only
              available if pdftops was  compiled  with  OPI  sup­
              port.)  [config file: psOPI]

       -noembt1
              By  default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in
              the PDF file are copied into the  PostScript  file.
              This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts
              instead.   Embedded  fonts  make  PostScript  files
              larger,  but  may be necessary for readable output.
              [config file: psEmbedType1Fonts]

       -noembtt
              By default, any TrueType fonts which  are  embedded
              in  the  PDF  file  are  copied into the PostScript
              file.  This option  causes  pdftops  to  substitute
              base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript
              files larger, but may  be  necessary  for  readable
              output.   Also, some PostScript interpreters do not
              have TrueType  rasterizers.   [config  file:  psEm­
              bedTrueTypeFonts]

       -paper size
              Set  the  paper  size  to one of "letter", "legal",
              "A4", or "A3".  [config file: psPaperSize]

       -paperw size
              Set the paper  width,  in  points.   [config  file:
              psPaperSize]

       -paperh size
              Set  the  paper  height,  in points.  [config file:
              psPaperSize]

       -duplex
              Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in  the  PostScript
              file.  This tells duplex-capable printers to enable
              duplexing.  [config file: psDuplex]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro­
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config  file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read  config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the sys­
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.   (-help  and  --help  are
              equivalent.)

BUGS
       No support for Type 3 fonts.
