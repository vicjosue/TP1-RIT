NAME
       shellmod  -  an  interpretor to run linuxconf module using
       /bin/sh

SYNOPSIS
       shellmod [ UI options ] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       shellmod is a solution  to  write  Linuxconf  modules  and
       standalone  utilities  using  either  /bin/sh  or perl. It
       offers access to Linuxconf  user  interface,  which  works
       transparently in text, graphic and HTML.

       The  goal  is  to  provide  a  very simple and easy to use
       scripting solution to create on site administration compo­
       nent. One can certainly create complex module with it, but
       the main goal was to replace the various  non  interactive
       administration scripts by interactive one, properly mapped
       in Linuxconf menuing system. This makes the administrators
       tasks   easier   (those  command  line  script  are  often
       lost...).

       The binding is fully described in the main help screen  of
       the shellmod utility. Type shellmod --build and select the
       help button.


OPTIONS
       --build
              starts a small dialog to  help  you  create  a  new
              script.  You  fill  the  various field (name of the
              script, where to hook it in  linuxconf  menu,  menu
              entry name, sub-menus, etc...) and a script is gen­
              erated.  From there, you edit the  script  and  add
              some programming.


       --exec is  used  to  execute the main function of an arbi­
              traty script within linuxconf context. You use  the
              option like this

              linuxconf  --modulemain shellmod --exec script_path
              script options


       --setmod
              registers a shellmod module in Linuxconf.

              linuxconf    --modulemain     shellmod     --setmod
              script_path


       --unsetmod
              remove a shellmod module from Linuxconf.

              linuxconf    --modulemain    shellmod    --unsetmod
              script_path
