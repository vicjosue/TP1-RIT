DESCRIPTION
       lpoptions  displays  or sets printer options and defaults.
       lpoptions shows the default printer options when run  with
       no arguments. Other options include:

       -d dest[/instance]
            Sets the default printer to dest. If instance is sup­
            plied then that particular  instance  is  used.  This
            option  overrides  the system default printer for the
            current user.

       -h server
            Specifies the CUPS server to communicate with.

       -l
            Lists the printer specific options and their  current
            settings.

       -o option=value
            Specifies a new option for the named destination.

       -p dest[/instance]
            Sets  the destination and instance, if specified, for
            any options that follow.  If the named instance  does
            not exist then it is created.

       -r option
            Removes  the  specified option for the named destina­
            tion.

       -x dest[/instance]
            Removes the options for  the  named  destination  and
            instance,  if  specified.  If the named instance does
            not exist then this does nothing.

       If no options are specified using the -o option  then  the
       current  options for the named printer are reported on the
       standard output.

       Options set with the lpoptions command  are  used  by  the
       lp(1) and lpr(1) commands when submitting jobs.

COMPATIBILITY
       The lpoptions command is unique to CUPS.
