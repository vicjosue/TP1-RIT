       This program will retrieve a document and store it in a
       local file.  It will follow any links found in the docu­
       ment and store these documents as well, patching links so
       that they refer to these local copies.  This process con­
       tinues until there are no more unvisited links or the pro­
       cess is stopped by the one or more of the limits which can
       be controlled by the command line arguments.

       This program is useful if you want to make a local copy of
       a collection of documents or want to do web reading off-
       line.

       All documents are stored as plain files in the current
       directory. The file names chosen are derived from the last
       component of URL paths.

       The options are:

       --auth=USER:PASn
          Set the authentication credentials to user "USER" and
          password "PASS" if any restricted parts of the web site
          are hit.  If there are restricted parts of the web site
          and authentication credentials are not available, those
          pages will not be downloaded.

       --depth=n
          Limit the recursive level. Embedded images are always
          loaded, even if they fall outside the --depth. This
          means that one can use --depth=0 in order to fetch a
          single document together with all inline graphics.

          The default depth is 5.

       --hier
          Download files into a hierarchy that mimics the web
          site structure.  The default is to put all files in the
          current directory.

       --referer=URI
          Set the value of the referer header for the initial
          request.  The special value ""NONE"" can be used to
          suppress the referer header in any of subsequent
          requests.

       --iis
          Sends an "Accept: */*" on all URL requests as a
          workaround for a bug in IIS 2.0.  If no Accept MIME
          header is present, IIS 2.0 returns with a "406 No
          acceptable objects were found" error.  Also converts
          any back slashes (\\) in URLs to forward slashes (/).


       --keepext=mime/type[,mime/type]
          Keeps the current extension for the list MIME types.
          Useful when downloading text/plain documents that
          shouldn't all be translated to *.txt files.

       --limit=n
          Limit the number of documents to get.  The default
          limit is 50.

       --nospace
          Changes spaces in all URLs to underscore characters
          (_).  Useful when downloading files from sites serving
          URLs with spaces in them.    Does not remove spaces
          from fragments, e.g., "file.html#somewhere in here".

       --prefix=url_prefix
          Limit the links to follow. Only URLs that start the
          prefix string are followed.

          The default prefix is set as the "directory" of the
          initial URL to follow.    For instance if we start lwp-
          rget with the URL "http://www.sn.no/foo/bar.html", then
          prefix will be set to "http://www.sn.no/foo/".

          Use "--prefix=''" if you don't want the fetching to be
          limited by any prefix.

       --sleep=n
          Sleep n seconds before retrieving each document. This
          options allows you to go slowly, not loading the server
          you visiting too much.

       --tolower
          Translates all links to lowercase.  Useful when down­
          loading files from IIS since it does not serve files in
          a case sensitive manner.

       --verbose
          Make more noise while running.

       --quiet
          Don't make any noise.

       --version
          Print program version number and quit.

       --help
          Print the usage message and quit.

       Before the program exits the name of the file, where the
       initial URL is stored, is printed on stdout.  All used
       filenames are also printed on stderr as they are loaded.
       This printing can be suppressed with the --quiet option.
