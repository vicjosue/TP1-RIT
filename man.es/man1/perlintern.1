       This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions
       in the Perl interpreter that are documented using Perl's
       internal documentation format but are not marked as part
       of the Perl API. In other words, tthheeyy aarree nnoott ffoorr uussee iinn

       is_gv_magical
               Returns "TRUE" if given the name of a magical GV.

               Currently only useful internally when determining
               if a GV should be created even in rvalue contexts.

               "flags" is not used at present but available for
               future extension to allow selecting particular
               classes of magical variable.

                       bool    is_gv_magical(char *name, STRLEN len, U32 flags)


       LVRET   True if this op will be the return value of an
               lvalue subroutine

       PL_DBsingle
               When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the --dd
               switch, this SV is a boolean which indicates
               whether subs are being single-stepped.  Single-
               stepping is automatically turned on after every
               step.  This is the C variable which corresponds to
               Perl's $DB::single variable.  See "PL_DBsub".

                       SV *    PL_DBsingle


       PL_DBsub
               When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the --dd
               switch, this GV contains the SV which holds the
               name of the sub being debugged.  This is the C
               variable which corresponds to Perl's $DB::sub
               variable.  See "PL_DBsingle".

                       GV *    PL_DBsub


       PL_DBtrace
               Trace variable used when Perl is run in debugging
               mode, with the --dd switch.  This is the C variable
               which corresponds to Perl's $DB::trace variable.
               See "PL_DBsingle".

                       SV *    PL_DBtrace


       PL_dowarn
               The C variable which corresponds to Perl's $^W
               warning variable.

                       bool    PL_dowarn


       PL_last_in_gv
               The GV which was last used for a filehandle input
               operation. ("<FH>")

                       GV*     PL_last_in_gv


       PL_ofs_sv
               The output field separator - "$," in Perl space.

                       SV*     PL_ofs_sv


       PL_rs   The input record separator - "$/" in Perl space.

                       SV*     PL_rs


AAUUTTHHOORRSS
       The autodocumentation system was originally added to the
       Perl core by Benjamin Stuhl. Documentation is by whoever
       was kind enough to document their functions.
