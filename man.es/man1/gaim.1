NAME
       Gaim v0.51 - Instant Messaging client

SYNOPSIS
       gaim [options]


DESCRIPTION
       gaim  is an Instant Messaging (IM) client designed primar­
       ily for use with AOL Instant Messager (AIM).  However,  it
       supports  most  other  popular IM protocols including ICQ,
       MSN Messager, Jabber, Yahoo!, IRC, Napster, and Zephyr.


OPTIONS
       The following options are provided by gaim using the stan­
       dard GNU command line syntax.

       -a, --acct
              Launch  the  account  editor  rather than the login
              window on start.

       -w, --away[=MESG]
              Automatically go away on signon.  You  may  option­
              ally  use  the  MESG parameter to set the away mes­
              sage.

       -l, --login[=NAME]
              Automatically login  on  start  using  the  default
              account or the account specified by the NAME param­
              eter.

       -u, --user=NAME
              Use account NAME as default.

       -f, --file=FILE
              Use FILE  as  the  configuration  file  instead  of
              ~/.gaimrc.


BUDDY LIST
       The  Buddy  List  Window  is gaim's main interface window.
       The focus of this window is the Buddy List  itself.   This
       is  a  list  of your contacts whose presence you have been
       notified of.

       The list of buddies is organized into groups.   Gaim  sup­
       ports  multiple  connections,  but  all online buddies are
       organized on the same buddy list.  Buddy List organization
       is handled in the Edit Buddies tab.

       Buddy Lists can be imported and exported to disk using the
       appropriate commands in the file menu.

       The icon to the left of each buddy indicates  the  buddy's
       current  state.   Double  clicking a buddy will open a new
       conversation window.  Right clicking will open a menu:

       IM     Opens a new conversation  window  to  the  selected
              buddy.

       Alias  Create  an alias for this buddy.  This will open up
              a new dialog in which one can give  this  buddy  an
              alternate  name  to appear on the buddy list and in
              conversataions.

              For example, if a  buddy's  name  screen  name  was
              jsmith1281xx and his real name was 'John Q. Smith,'
              one could create an alias as to identify the  buddy
              by his common name.

       Add Buddy Pounce
              A  Buddy  Pounce is a configurable automated action
              to be performed when  the  buddy's  state  changes.
              This  will  open the Buddy Pounce dialog to be dis­
              cussed later.

       View Log
              gaim is capable of automatically  log  its  activi­
              ties.   These  logs  are  html  files  (with a .log
              extenstion) located in the ~/.gaim/logs  directory.
              This  menu  command  will attempt to view this file
              with gaim's internal log viewer.

       The remainder of the menu will consist  of  protocol  spe­
       cific  commands.   If logged on with multiple connections,
       these will appear in submenus named with each screen  name
       logged on.  These commands vary depending on the protocol;
       below are the commands available  when  using  OSCAR,  the
       more popular and developer-recommended AIM protocol:

       Get Info
              Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.
              This information is also known as a Profile.

       Get Away Msg
              If this buddy  is  in  an  Away  state,  this  will
              retrieve and display the buddy's Away Message.

       Direct IM
              This  will send a request to the buddy for a Direct
              IM.  If accepted, a direct connection will be  made
              between  the  two clients, no longer relying on the
              server.  This will reveal your IP address  to  your
              buddy, which may constitute a security risk.


The Conversation Window
       When  starting  a  new conversation, the user is presented
       with the conversation window.  The conversation appears in
       the  upper  text box and the user types his message in the
       lower.  Between the two is a row of  setting,  represented
       by icons.  From left to right:

       Bold   adds <b></b> to your message

       Italics
              adds <i></i> to your message

       Underline
              adds <u></u> to your message

       Strikethrough
              adds <s></s> to your message

       Decrease font size
              adds <font size="1"></font> to your message

       Default font size
              adds <font size="3"></font> to your message

       Increase font size
              adds <font size="5"></font> to your message

       Select font face
              adds an appropriate font tag to your message.

       Select a foreground color
              adds an appropriate font tag to your message.

       Select a background color
              adds an appropriate body tag to your message.

       Add hyperlink
              adds an appropriate a href tag to your message.

       Add smiley
              adds  an  ASCII  smiley to your message.  This will
              become a graphic smiley in the upper textbox if the
              option for graphical smileys is set.

       Enable logging
              As  the conversation continues, everything will get
              logged to a log file in ~/.gaim/logs

       Save Conversation
              Saves the current conversation to  a  log  file  of
              your choice.

       Enable Sounds
              Choose  whether  events  in  this conversation will
              trigger sounds.

              Beneath the lower textbox is a row of buttons  that
              execute commands:

       Send   This sends what's currently in the lower textbox

       Get Info
              This  gets  information (a profile) about the other
              person in the conversation.

       Warn   This issues a warning to the other  person  in  the
              conversation.

       Block  This adds the other person to your deny list.

       Add to buddy list
              This  adds  this  user  to  your buddy list.  If he
              already is on your list, it will  remove  him  from
              it.

       Close  Closes this window.



Edit Buddies
       Clicking this tab on the Buddy List Window will invoke the
       main interface to edit and organize buddy lists.   Buddy's
       already  in  your  buddy  list  can  be moved to different
       groups or reordered in the  same  group  by  clicking  and
       dragging with the mouse.  One can also add, rename, alias,
       or delete buddies here, as well as some of  the  functions
       available in the Buddy List Dialog.

       In  the  Edit Buddies dialog, the list is arranged by con­
       nection.  If two or more connections have a group  of  the
       same,  the  Buddy  List will only show one group with that
       name.  Available buddies from  both  connections  will  be
       shown  in  this  group.   If both connections have a buddy
       with the same screen name in a group of the same name, the
       buddy will appear only once.


Buddy Chat
       For  protocols  that  allow it, Buddy Chats can be entered
       through the file menu, the keyboard  shortcut  CTRL+C,  or
       the  right most button on the bottom of the uddy List Dia­
       log.

       Additional commands available in chat,  depending  on  the
       protocol are:

       Whisper
              The  text will appear in the chat conversation, but
              it will only be  visible  to  the  sender  and  the
              receiver.

       Invite Invite other people to join the chat room.

       Ignore Ignore anything said by the chosen person

       Set Topic
              Set  the topic of the chat room.  This is usually a
              brief  sentence  describing  the  nature   of   the
              chat--an explanation of the chat room's name.


AWAY MESSAGES
       Most  protocols  allow  for away messages.  When a user is
       away, he can leave a message indicating why for others  to
       see.   The  away  submenu of the Tools menu is used to add
       and remove away message, as well as to set a  user's  away
       state.

       New  Away  Message provides space for one to enter an away
       message and a title for that message.  If Save of  Save  &
       Use  are chosen, this message will be saved.  It can later
       be referred to by the title given to it.

       Remove Away Message is a submenu containing the titles  of
       saved away messages.  Clicking on one of these titles will
       remove the away message associated with it.

       The rest of the away menu provides the user with a way  to
       assign  different  away messages to different connections.
       Choosing Set All Away will set away  all  the  connections
       capable of the away state.


BUDDY POUNCE
       A  Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a
       buddy returns to a normal state from  an  away  state.   A
       pounce  can  be  set  to  occur  on any combination of the
       events listed, and any combination of actions can  result.
       If Save this pounce after activation is checked, the trig­
       ger will remain until it is removed from the Remove  buddy
       pounce menu.


ACCOUNT EDITOR
       The  account  editor  consists  of  a list of accounts and
       information about  them.   Clicking  Add  or  Modify  will
       invoke  a  Modify  Account  window.   Here,  you can alter
       information about  your  account.   When  creating  a  new
       account,  you  will  submit your screen name and password.
       You will also choose your protocol; The two AIM protocols,
       TOC  and  OSCAR are always loaded, but other protocols can
       be dynamically loaded and unloaded using Protocols Plugins
       (PRPLS).

       If Remember Password is chosen, the password will be saved
       in gaim's configuration file.

       If Auto-Login is chosen, this account  will  automatically
       login upon starting gaim.

       Each  protocol  has  it's own specific options that can be
       found in the protocol-specific tab on the modify screen.


PERL
       /fBGaim/fR allows for perl scripting.  This  submenu  pro­
       vides  for  the loading of individual perl scripts and for
       the unloading of all of them.   See  PERL-HOWTO  for  more
       information about perl scripting.


PLUGINS
       /fBGain/fR  allows  for  dynamic  loading of plugins.  The
       plugin window shows the paths to  loaded  plugins  on  the
       left,  and  the  name and description of the plugin on the
       right.

       You may load and unload plugins using the appropriate but­
       tons.

       Show Buddy Ticker
              This  opens  the  Buddy  Ticker,  a small window in
              which the contents of your  buddy  list  scroll  to
              keep you up to date on their status.

       Show Debug Window

       Report Idle Times
              For protocol's that require the  client  to  report
              idle  times,  this option sets the method of deter­
              mining idle times.  If  None  is  chosen,  idleness
              will  not  be  reported.  If Gaim Use is chosen, it
              will send idle times relative to the last time gaim
              was  used.   If X Use is chosen, idle times will be
              reported based on the last time the mouse  or  key­
              board was used.

       Logging

       Show graphical smileys
              This will convert emoticons such as :) and >:-O  to
              small icons representing them.

       Show timestamp on messages
              When  selected,  this option shows in the conversa­
              tion window, the time each message was received  or
              sent.

       Show URLs as links
              This  will convert URLs such as http://gaim.source­
              forge.net to a hyperlink pointing to that site.

       Highlight misspelled words
              While typing a message, if a user misspells a word,
              it  will  immediately  turn red.  Right-clicking on
              the word will invoke a  menu  of  possible  correc­
              tions.

       Sending messages removes away status
              If  this  option is selected, a user will come back
              from away if he sends a message to someone.

       Queue new messages when away
              This option will cause new conversation windows not
              to  be  created  until  a  user  returns from away.
              Instead, a record of how many messages received and
              from  whom  they were received is shown in the away
              message window.

       Ignore colors/font faces/ font sizes
              These options ignore font settings that can be  set
              in HTML tags.

       Ignore TiK Automated Messages
              AOL's  open  source  TiK  client gets a user's away
              message by sending him an automated message.   This
              option ignores those messages.

       Ignore new conversations when away
              If  checked,  new  conversations  will  be  ignored
              entirely when away.  Unlike the Queue new  messages
              when  away option, no record will be kept of these.

Windows
       Show buttons as:
              This option selects the look of the buttons.

       Show all conversations in one tabbed window
              Instead of seperate windows for each  conversation,
              they  are  all shown in one window with tabs at the
              top to select the conversation.  A name  on  a  tab
              will  become  red  if a new message hasn't yet been
              read.

       Raise windows on events
              When an event happens to a conversation,  the  con­
              versation  window  will  be  raised above all other
              windows on the desktop.

       Show logins in window
              This will show when buddies log in and out  in  the
              conversation window, if one is open for that buddy.

       Window size
              Select the default size for new  conversation  win­
              dows.

Font Options
        These  set  the  font  preferences that are sent with all
       messages over a protocol that supports HTML.

Chat Rooms
       This is a list of available chat rooms and chat rooms that
       you are subscribed to.

Sounds
       No sounds when you log in
              This  will prevent sounds from playing when gaim is
              first notified of your buddy's presence because you
              just signed on.

       Sounds while away
              This  option will continue to play sounds on events
              if you are away.

       Beep instead of playing sound
              This will cause a terminal beep instead of a  sound
              upon events.

       Command to play sound files
              If  you  need  a special command executed to play a
              sound, enter it in the given box with %s represent­
              ing  the  filename.  If you prefer gaim to play the
              sound, leave it blank.

       Events Choose sounds to play when each event occurs.

Away Messages
       Don't send auto-response
              If someone sends the user  a  message  while  away,
              gaim will not respond with the away message if this
              is checked.

       Auto Away
              If this is selected gaim will automatically go away
              if it's been idle for the specified length of time.
