DESCRIPTION
   Supported Printers
       The ghostscript device driver pcl3 (formerly called  hpdj)
       is   a  ghostscript  backend  for  printers  understanding
       Hewlett-Packard's Printer Command Language, level 3+ ("PCL
       3+", also called "PCL 3 Plus").  The driver is intended to
       support in particular the following printer models:

              HP DeskJet
              HP DeskJet Plus
              HP DeskJet Portable
              HP DeskJet 310
              HP DeskJet 320
              HP DeskJet 340
              HP DeskJet 400
              HP DeskJet 500
              HP DeskJet 500C
              HP DeskJet 510
              HP DeskJet 520
              HP DeskJet 540
              HP DeskJet 550C
              HP DeskJet 560C
              HP DeskJet 600
              HP DeskJet 660C
              HP DeskJet 670C
              HP DeskJet 680C
              HP DeskJet 690C
              HP DeskJet 850C
              HP DeskJet 855C
              HP DeskJet 870C
              HP DeskJet 890C
              HP DeskJet 1120C

       The PCL dialect called "PCL Level 3  enhanced"  is  appar­
       ently  a  not  entirely compatible modification of PCL 3+.
       This driver should basically work with such  printers  but
       you  must be more careful which options you select and you
       might not be able to exploit all your printer's  capabili­
       ties.

       The  driver  does  not support printers understanding only
       Hewlett-Packard's PPA (Printing Performance  Architecture)
       commands.   If a printer's documentation does not say any­
       thing about its printer command language and  you  find  a
       statement  like "... is designed for Microsoft Windows" or
       "DOS support through Windows only", the printer is  almost
       certainly  a PPA printer and hence is intended exclusively
       for systems running Microsoft  Windows.   (These  printers
       are  also erroneously known as "GDI printers" because they
       are intended to be accessed  through  a  manufacturer-sup­
       plied  driver  via  Windows'  GDI interface.)  There exist
       ways of using a PPA  printer  with  ghostscript,  but  not
       through pcl3.

       Different  printer models usually implement model-specific
       subsets of all PCL-3+ commands or arguments  to  commands.
       You  must therefore tell the driver by means of the Subde­
       vice option for which model  the  generated  PCL  code  is
       intended.  The model-dependent difference in the generated
       code is not great.  Apart from media specifications, reso­
       lutions  and  colour  capabilities, one can consider three
       groups of models which are treated with  significant  dif­
       ferences:

              Group 1   DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500

              Group 2   DeskJet  Portable, DeskJets 3xx, 400, 5xx
                        except 500 and 540,

              Group 3   DeskJets 540, 6xx, 8xx and 1120C.

       The first two groups I call the "old Deskjets", the  third
       group  consists  of  "new  DeskJets".  If you have a PCL-3
       printer not appearing in the list above, the likelihood is
       still  good  that  it  will  accept the files generated by
       pcl3.  You can specify one of the supported subdevices  in
       these  cases  (it  is  sufficient to try one each from the
       groups just mentioned), or use the special subdevice names
       unspecold  or unspec which are treated like members of the
       second and the third group above, respectively,  with  all
       subdevice-dependent checks having been turned off.

       The  list  of printer models for which this driver is cur­
       rently known to work is:

              HP 2000C
              HP 2500CM
              HP DeskJet 697C
              HP DeskJet 850C
              HP DeskJet 970C
              HP DeskJet 1100C
              Xerox DocuPrint M750

       Details can be found in the file reports.txt in  the  pcl3
       distribution;  its  latest version is available via pcl3's
       home page (link to  URL  http://home.t-online.de/home/Mar­
       tin.Lottermoser/pcl3.html) .  If you wish to report on the
       hardware compatibility for  a  particular  printer  model,
       please read the file how-to-report.txt.

       Omitting  models  already  mentioned, previous (hpdj) ver­
       sions of this driver were reported to work with  the  fol­
       lowing printers:

              Olivetti JP792 (see the option SendBlackLast)

       Most  of  the  people who sent me reports did not state to
       which extent hpdj worked for their printer model.

   Colour Models
       Ignoring photo cartridges which are not supported by pcl3,
       DeskJet printers can be classified in four categories:

          ·  The printer has only a black ink cartridge.

          ·  The  printer  can  print  with  either  a black or a
             cyan/magenta/yellow (CMY) cartridge.

          ·  The printer holds a CMY and a black cartridge simul­
             taneously, but the two groups of inks are chemically
             incompatible and should not  be  overlayed.   (Don't
             worry:  the  printer is not going to explode if they
             do.  You merely get poorer results because the black
             ink  will  spread  further  than it should.  This is
             called "ink bleeding".)

          ·  The printer holds a CMY and a black cartridge simul­
             taneously  and  the  inks  can  be mixed.  (Newer HP
             DeskJets use such bleed-proof inks.)

       This leads to four (process) colour models for the driver:


              Gray      Print in black only.

              CMY       Print  with cyan, magenta and yellow.  In
                        this mode, "composite  black"  consisting
                        of all three inks is used to stand in for
                        true black.

              CMY+K     Print with all four inks, but  never  mix
                        black with one of the others.

              CMYK      Print with all four inks.

       As  a  printer with both, a black and a CMY cartridge, can
       usually also print, e.g., with black only,  the  printer's
       "cartridge state" merely identifies one of these models as
       the  maximal  one.   Depending  on  the  category  of  the
       printer, the driver will therefore accept one or more mod­
       els.  The possibilities are:

              DeskJet Model                        Colour Models
              ------------------------------------------------------
              DeskJet,  DeskJet  Plus,   DeskJet   Gray
              Portable, 500, 510, 520
              310, 320, 340, 400, 500C, 540, 600   Gray, CMY
              550C, 560C                           Gray, CMY, CMY+K
              660C,   670C,  680C,  690C,  850C,   all
              855C, 870C, 890C, 1120C

       The subdevices unspecold and unspec also permit all colour
       models.   A printer capable only of CMY might accept CMY+K
       or CMYK data, remapping them to CMY, and a printer capable
       of CMY+K might remap CMY data to CMY+K.

       The  colour  model  CMY+K is not useful if you have a CMYK
       printer.  In contrast, if you have a CMY+K or CMYK printer
       and  the two cartridges support different resolutions, the
       colour models Gray or CMY become interesting as well.   In
       most  of  these  cases  the black cartridge can print at a
       higher resolution than the  CMY  cartridge,  although  the
       converse  does  also  occur.   In addition, ghostscript is
       generally fastest for Gray.

       PCL 3+  also  supports  the  colour  model  RGB   although
       Hewlett-Packard  discourages  its use.  For this model the
       printer internally converts the RGB data it receives  into
       CMY data for printing.  Note that not everything which can
       be demanded when using a CMY palette  in  PCL 3+  is  also
       permitted  when using RGB.  Because of its limited useful­
       ness, pcl3 accepts the colour model RGB only for the  sub­
       devices unspecold and unspec.

   Media Sizes and Orientations
       A  PostScript  document describes its visible content with
       respect to a coordinate system called default user  space.
       Almost all PostScript devices are page devices which paint
       only a restricted rectangular area in default user  space.
       Part  of  the state of a page device is therefore the cur­
       rent page size,  two  numbers  specifying  the  width  and
       height  of  the sheet to be printed on.  These values must
       be interpreted from default user  space,  hence  the  page
       size  not only describes the "sheet size" (extension irre­
       spective of orientation) but also the orientation  between
       page  contents  and  sheet  (portrait  if width <= height,
       landscape otherwise).  The page size is requested  by  the
       user  or  the  document,  and it is one of the jobs of the
       device to satisfy this request.

       Ghostscript looks at several sources to determine the page
       size:

          ·  the  default  size  configured  for  gs  (usually US
             Letter or ISO A4 in portrait orientation),

          ·  the value given to the option PAPERSIZE in the invo­
             cation,

          ·  the size requested by the document, unless you spec­
             ify -dFIXEDMEDIA.

       The last applicable item in this list overrides  the  oth­
       ers, hence the current page size can change at runtime.

       The  pcl3  driver splits the page size into sheet size and
       page orientation and passes the sheet size to the printer.
       This works only if the printer accepts this size (accepted
       sizes are listed  in  your  printer's  manual).   For  the
       explicitly  supported  printers,  the  driver  knows which
       sizes are accepted and will refuse to print if  an  unsup­
       ported  one is requested.  (If you suspect that pcl3 is in
       error concerning what is supported, check the list of sup­
       ported  sizes  in  the  PPD file for the subdevice you are
       using.)  Group-3 printers also accept a custom  page  size
       command  which permits printing on arbitrarily-sized media
       but only within certain limits which are also known to the
       driver.   Unlike  the  sheet  size the page orientation is
       irrelevant for deciding whether a particular page size  is
       supported  or  not.   The  driver  will  adapt  itself  as
       required by the PostScript language and rotate the  output
       if  necessary.   (I  know  of  only  one other ghostscript
       driver capable of this.)

       In setting up the PostScript default user space, pcl3 does
       not treat envelope sizes differently from other sizes.

       The subdevice unspecold accepts all sizes supported by the
       HP DeskJet 560C, unspec supports all discrete sizes  known
       to the HP DeskJets 850C/855C/870C/890C and treats in addi­
       tion every other size request as a custom page size  with­
       out imposing any limits.  If using any of these two subde­
       vices you should change the list of supported sizes to fit
       your printer's capabilities; see the CONFIGURATION section
       below for details.

       In order for a document to be printed correctly a sheet of
       appropriate size must be provided and the driver must know
       what its orientation with respect to the  printing  mecha­
       nism  is.  The latter is usually specified by reference to
       the feeding direction as "short edge first" or "long  edge
       first".   Don't  confuse this kind of orientation with the
       portrait/landscape orientation: the former ("sheet  orien­
       tation")  refers  to  the  orientation  of  the sheet with
       respect to the feeding direction, the latter ("page orien­
       tation")  describes  the  orientation  of  the  sheet with
       respect to the page contents (default user space).   These
       orientations  are  logically independent: people inserting
       paper into the printer need to know about the first,  peo­
       ple composing documents only care about the latter.

       Because pcl3 has no information about the actual dimension
       or orientation of the medium in the input tray,  you  must
       ensure yourself that this is appropriate.  By default, the
       driver assumes the dimension to be that requested via  the
       page  size,  but  you can override this assumption with an
       InputAttributes definition (see the Media Sources and Des­
       tinations  subsection in the CONFIGURATION section below).

       There is no command in PCL 3+ to tell  the  printer  about
       the  sheet's  orientation  in the input tray, therefore it
       cannot be chosen and the manufacturer must  prescribe  it.
       I  am not aware of any precise and complete statement from
       Hewlett-Packard about what is required  in  this  respect,
       hence  you  should check your printer's manual whether the
       assumptions made by pcl3 are correct or  not:  the  driver
       assumes  that media are always fed short edge first except
       when using the subdevices hpdj, hpdjplus, hpdj400, hpdj500
       or  hpdj500c for printing on envelope sizes (US no. 10 and
       ISO DL).  In these cases you should insert the medium long
       edge  first.  If you find that pcl3's default behaviour is
       incorrect, you can override it with the option LeadingEdge
       or  a media configuration file (see the CONFIGURATION sec­
       tion below).

   Print Quality and Media Properties
       With the introduction of the DeskJet 540, HP added two new
       PCL  commands  to the language: "Print Quality" and "Media
       Type".  For older  DeskJets  (groups  1  and  2),  similar
       effects  can  be  achieved  by  specifying  some technical
       aspects of the printing process in detail.

       You can use the PrintQuality and Medium options  to  adapt
       the driver to the desired output quality and those proper­
       ties of the medium it  must  know  about,  independent  of
       which  kind of subdevice you select.  If it corresponds to
       a printer understanding the new commands, the option  val­
       ues  are  passed  through  to the printer, otherwise these
       specifications are mapped to the  older  Depletion,  Shin­
       gling,  and Raster Graphics Quality commands based on rec­
       ommendations from HP.  If you are not satisfied  with  the
       result  in  the  latter  case,  use the options Depletion,
       Shingling  and  RasterGraphicsQuality  to  explicitly  set
       these values.

   Diagnostic Messages
       Error  messages issued by this driver start with "? compo­
       nent:" and warnings with "?-W component:".  The  component
       can  be  eprn,  pcl3,  or  pclgen,  corresponding  to  the
       driver's three internal layers: the  eprn  device  extends
       ghostscript without knowing PCL, pclgen is a module gener­
       ating PCL without being aware of ghostscript, and pcl3  is
       the driver proper connecting the other two layers.

       All  these  messages  are  written  on  the standard error
       stream.

OPTIONS
       When specifying options for gs you  should  keep  in  mind
       that case is significant, that some options must be passed
       as strings (-s) and others as  general  tokens  (-d),  and
       that  gs effectively ignores every option it does not rec­
       ognize.  Hence some care in spelling  parameter  names  is
       necessary.

       If  you are confused by the large number of options, don't
       worry.  Just ignore those you don't understand and concen­
       trate first on the following ones, given here in the order
       of their importance: -sDEVICE, -sSubdevice, -sColourModel,
       -r,  -sPrintQuality,  and -sMedium.  You should also check
       whether there is an entry in the reports.txt file  in  the
       pcl3  distribution listing working option combinations for
       your printer.

   Standard Options
       When calling gs with the pcl3 driver you can  specify  any
       option  defined  for  ghostscript's  prn  (printer) device
       although some have particular  meanings  or  restrictions.
       This  includes all device-independent options described in
       gs(1).  You should also look into  ghostscript's  extended
       documentation (file Use.htm (link to URL Use.htm)  and the
       section   Device   parameters   (link    to    URL    Lan­
       guage.htm#Device_parameters) in Language.htm).

       -sDEVICE=pcl3
                 This  specification selects the pcl3 driver, but
                 this is not the only way to select it with  this
                 option.   See  the  description of the Subdevice
                 option below for other possibilities.

       -dDuplex[=boolean] or -dDuplex=null
                 This parameter requests duplex printing and  can
                 be  set  to  true only for unspec and unspecold,
                 and when the DuplexCapability value is not none.
                 The  default is null which for this driver means
                 that the printer's default setting will be used.

                 If your printer does not support duplex printing
                 you can achieve  the  same  effect  manually  by
                 printing  the odd and even pages separately (use
                 a command  like  psselect(1)  from  the  psutils
                 package  for  extracting  these parts) and rein­
                 serting the paper in between.

       -r resolution
                 This option specifies the resolution  in  pixels
                 per  inch  (ppi;  sometimes also called dots per
                 inch, dpi).  The driver checks whether the  sub­
                 device  selected  accepts  the  given resolution
                 unless the subdevice  is  unspecold  or  unspec.
                 Resolutions  supported  by  at least some of the
                 other subdevices for some of the  colour  models
                 are  75,  100,  150,  300,  600×300 and 600 ppi.
                 Consult the PPD files in the  pcl3  distribution
                 if  you  want  to know the details.  The default
                 resolution for pcl3 is 300 ppi.

                 At least the highest possible  value  should  be
                 listed  in  your printer's manual, but some care
                 is necessary in the  interpretation:  the  value
                 given  to pcl3 must be a resolution supported by
                 the printer's hardware for all the colorants  in
                 the process colour model simultaneously and when
                 operating in raster graphics mode.   You  should
                 also  keep  in mind that if your printer has two
                 cartridges they might support different sets  of
                 resolutions,  i.e.,  which  resolution  you  can
                 choose might depend on the colour model.  It  is
                 also  possible  that the print quality has to be
                 considered as well.  If you  are  in  doubt  and
                 have  access  to  a manufacturer-endorsed driver
                 for your printer, use pcl3opts to find out about
                 the settings used by that driver.

                 At  least  some of the series-500 DeskJets claim
                 to permit a resolution of 600 × 300  ppi.   How­
                 ever,  although  these  models  have  a  600 dpi
                 addressable horizontal resolution grid  they  do
                 not  permit  neighbouring pixels to be activated
                 (and the dots printed still have a  diameter  of
                 about  1/300  in).  The raster data generated by
                 gs does not obey this restriction.  In addition,
                 it  is  possible  that  the higher resolution is
                 anyway only supported for the printer's  builtin
                 fonts and not for general raster data.

                 Concerning  the  DeskJet  870C, my impression is
                 that although some HP documents and drivers  use
                 expressions  like  "600x300 dpi C-REt color" for
                 this printer, the model does not really  support
                 a  resolution  of 600 × 300 ppi.  First, it does
                 not accept pcl3's output with  this  resolution,
                 and  second,  if one inspects the best output of
                 HP's  Windows  driver  for  this  printer   with
                 pcl3opts,  one finds that the file uses a "mixed
                 resolution", i.e., 600 ppi for black and 300 ppi
                 for CMY.  This is not supported by pcl3.

   Pcl3-Specific Options
       -dBlackLevels=levels and -dCMYLevels=levels
                 These options set the number of intensity levels
                 per pixel and colorant to use when printing with
                 black  or  CMY  inks,  respectively, and must be
                 consistent with the colour model.   They  permit
                 access   to   the  printer's  Colour  Resolution
                 Enhancement  technology  (C-REt)  feature.   The
                 defaults  are  0  or  2, depending on the colour
                 model chosen.  Other values  are  only  accepted
                 for   the  subdevices  hpdj8nnc,  hpdj1120c  and
                 unspec, and when not using the colour model RGB.

                 The  subdevice  unspec  accepts any non-negative
                 number of levels except 1 up to 256.  The subde­
                 vices  hpdj8nnc  and hpdj1120c accept the levels
                 0, 2, 3 and 4 with the following restrictions if
                 any  of  the  levels  is  larger  than  2 (these
                 restrictions have been determined experimentally
                 with a DeskJet 850C and are not based on HP doc­
                 umentation):

                    ·  You can't  use  this  feature  with  draft
                       quality.

                    ·  You can't use a colour model of CMY.

                    ·  You must use a resolution of 300 ppi.

                    ·  You must use 4 levels for black.

                 When  using  the  subdevice  unspec  you  should
                 expect the printer to similarly limit the possi­
                 bilities.   In  particular  you  must expect the
                 permitted number of levels to depend  on  colour
                 model,  resolution  and print quality.  So far I
                 have not heard of a  PCL-3+  printer  supporting
                 more than four intensity levels per colorant.

       -sColorModel=model or -sColourModel=model
                 This  selects the colour model to be used by the
                 driver: Gray, RGB,  CMY,  CMY+K  or  CMYK.   The
                 default   is  Gray.   Which  colour  models  are
                 accepted depends on the  subdevice,  see  Colour
                 Models in the section DESCRIPTION above.

                 A  value of CMY for this option also sets Black­
                 Levels to zero, and if CMYLevels  is  zero  when
                 you  demand any of CMY, CMY+K or CMYK, it is set
                 to two.  For RGB, effectively the  same  happens
                 as  for  CMY.  For all other situations you must
                 ensure yourself that colour model and  intensity
                 levels  are  consistent  or  pcl3 will complain.
                 This rule implies that you can ignore the  level
                 options  unless  you  want  to use a non-default
                 number of levels.

                 The PostScript page device dictionary entry Pro­
                 cessColorModel  will not be correct for a colour
                 model of CMY or CMY+K.  (Ghostscript returns the
                 native  colour  space in this parameter, not the
                 process colour model.)

       -dCompressionMethod=method
                 PCL interpreters understand several  compression
                 methods  for  raster  graphics  data in order to
                 speed up host-printer communication.  The possi­
                 ble choices are:

                 0   Unencoded, non-compressed
                 1   Runlength encoding
                 2   Tagged  Image File Format
                     (TIFF)    revision    4.0
                     "Packbits" encoding
                 3   Delta Row Compression
                 9   Compressed    Replacement
                     Delta Row Encoding

                 The default method is 9 except  for  the  subde­
                 vices  hpdj, hpdjplus, and hpdj500 where it is 3
                 (these printers do not  support  method 9),  and
                 for the subdevices unspec and unspecold where it
                 is 2 (this seems to give the best combination of
                 portability and compression).  Requesting method
                 3 actually leads to a combination of  methods  2
                 and 3.  The driver may temporarily choose method
                 0 if a compressed data sequence would be  longer
                 than its uncompressed version.

                 Compression  rates can vary drastically, depend­
                 ing on the structure  of  the  input.   However,
                 although  the  absolute values change, the rela­
                 tive order of efficiency between the methods  is
                 usually  the  order  of  increasing  method.  In
                 short: use method 9 if it is supported.

       -dConfigureEveryPage[=boolean]
                 This parameter, if set to true, will  force  the
                 printer  to be reconfigured for every page.  The
                 option is superfluous  for  printers  which  are
                 truly PCL-3-conforming.

                 Use  this parameter if you discover that you can
                 print single-page documents without problems but
                 that  the  printer  does  not  accept multi-page
                 files.  At present, the only printer I  know  of
                 for  which  such  a reconfiguration is needed is
                 the Xerox DocuPrint M750.

       -dCUPSAccounting[=boolean]
                 You will usually  specify  this  parameter  when
                 using  pcl3  as  the  final  component in a CUPS
                 (Common UNIX Printing System) driver.   It  will
                 lead  to appropriate page accounting messages on
                 standard error.  The default for this  parameter
                 is false.

                 If you have set this parameter to true you can't
                 set it back to false.  The driver will  generate
                 a warning if this is attempted.

                 When  using  pcl3  within CUPS you will normally
                 set  both,  CUPSAccounting   and   CUPSMessages.
                 There  exist, however, CUPS configurations where
                 page accounting messages should be generated  by
                 a  command  further down the print pipeline than
                 pcl3 (e.g., by a CUPS backend  capable  of  pro­
                 cessing  PJL  Page Status messages and driving a
                 printer which sends them).  In these  cases  you
                 should not specify -dCUPSAccounting.

       -dCUPSMessages[=boolean]
                 Specify this parameter when using pcl3 as a com­
                 ponent in a CUPS (Common UNIX  Printing  System)
                 driver.  It will modify the format of error mes­
                 sages and warnings as  expected  by  CUPS.   The
                 default for this parameter is false.

       -dDepletion=depletion
                 This  option  is only available for old DeskJets
                 (including  unspecold)  and  when  printing   in
                 colour.  The integer depletion controls an algo­
                 rithm  for  removing  certain  pixels  from  the
                 image;  this  leads to less ink being applied to
                 the medium.  The possible values  for  depletion
                 are:

                 1   No depletion
                 2   25%
                 3   50%
                 4   25% with gamma correction
                 5   50% with gamma correction

                 The  default  value  is  derived from Medium and
                 PrintQuality.  The values 4 and 5 are not under­
                 stood  by  the  DeskJet  500C,  but even for the
                 other  printers  these  values  are  not  useful
                 because  PostScript  permits  finer  control for
                 gamma correction through transfer functions (see
                 the  subsection  Transfer  Functions in the next
                 section).

       -dDryTime=delay
                 With the exception of the DeskJets 500 and 500C,
                 series-500 DeskJet printers can be told to guar­
                 antee a minimum drying  time  of  delay  seconds
                 before  the  next  page of the same print job is
                 dropped on a newly printed page.  (This interval
                 can  be  terminated  by  pressing the Load/Eject
                 button.)  The printer will choose default values
                 depending on the current print quality, hence it
                 is normally not necessary to specify this option
                 and  the feature is even considered obsolete for
                 post-series-500 DeskJets although  it  is  still
                 supported by some of them.

                 Permissible  values for delay are null and inte­
                 gers  in  the  range  0  to  1200,  where   null
                 instructs  pcl3 not to send a corresponding com­
                 mand, 0 establishes default values for the  cur­
                 rent print quality, and all other values explic­
                 itly  request  the  duration  in  seconds.   The
                 default is null.

       -sDuplexCapability=capability
                 Looking  at  the  final  result (sheet printed),
                 there are two kinds of duplex  printing  identi­
                 fied  by  the two possible values for the option
                 Tumble.  Not  all  printers  capable  of  duplex
                 printing,  however, provide the hardware support
                 necessary for both, hence  the  driver  must  be
                 told what the printer offers in order to be able
                 to compensate  for  the  missing  functionality.
                 The  parameter capability can be any of the fol­
                 lowing:

                 none                  no duplex capability
                 sameLeadingEdge       second pass  of  sheet
                                       occurs  with  the same
                                       leading edge
                 oppositeLeadingEdge   second pass  of  sheet
                                       occurs  with the oppo­
                                       site leading edge
                 both                  second pass  of  sheet
                                       can  occur with either
                                       edge

                 This option can only be specified for  unspecold
                 and unspec.  The default value is none.

                 The  correct  setting for the HP DeskJet 970C is
                 oppositeLeadingEdge,  but  the  printer  permits
                 access  to  its duplex functionality only if you
                 specify in addition -sPJLLanguage=PCL3GUI  -dOn­
                 lyCRD.   (Many  thanks  to  Dawei W. Dong for an
                 extensive series of experiments.)

                 If a printer does not offer hardware support for
                 both  orientations,  the  document to be printed
                 must execute showpage  after  a  possible  page-
                 level  restore  and  not  before,  otherwise the
                 driver will not be able to  compensate  for  the
                 missing  functionality  and  only one of the two
                 Tumble values will work.  All DSC-3.0-conforming
                 PostScript files have the required property.

       -sIntensityRendering=method
                 Most  printers, including every PCL-3+ printer I
                 know of, can  render  only  a  small  number  of
                 intensities per pixel and colorant.  In the most
                 frequent case, merely two levels  are  possible.
                 As this is usually not sufficient, various meth­
                 ods  have  been  devised  to  achieve  a  larger
                 palette; this is possible at the expense of spa­
                 tial  resolution.   Because  of  this   tradeoff
                 between  effective  resolution and the number of
                 colours which can  be  distinguished,  the  best
                 method  for a given document depends on the con­
                 tents of the document and the user should there­
                 fore be able to select it.

                 The  pcl3  driver supports the following methods
                 for intensity rendering:

                 Floyd-Steinberg   use Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion

                 The default method is  halftones.   The  methods
                 differ  only  in  their treatment of intensities
                 which cannot  be  represented  directly  by  the
                 printer.   If your document contains for example
                 only black  text,  they  all  produce  the  same
                 result, albeit at different speeds.

                 With  printer,  pcl3 will cause everything to be
                 painted at the full hardware resolution but will
                 have  to  map  all colours to the nearest levels
                 the printer can represent directly.  For  a  CMY
                 or  CMYK printer with two intensity levels, this
                 results in just  8  useful  colours  per  pixel.
                 This  value  is  therefore usually only sensible
                 for documents with a small number of widely dif­
                 ferent  saturated  colours where accurate colour
                 reproduction is of minor importance but  achiev­
                 ing  the  highest  possible resolution is essen­
                 tial.  Another possible application is the  case
                 of  PostScript  input  which  has  already  been
                 adapted to the printer's resolution  and  avail­
                 able intensity levels.

                 With  halftones, ghostscript will use what looks
                 like standard PostScript halftoning  algorithms.
                 For  details, consult a PostScript manual.  How­
                 ever, you should know that ghostscript's current
                 halftoning implementation has some problems:

                    ·  The algorithm cannot handle different non-
                       zero values for BlackLevels and CMYLevels.
                       In  this  situation  gs  will  in  general
                       assume that the  number  of  black  levels
                       available is equal to that for CMY levels.
                       Depending  on  which  of  the  numbers  is
                       smaller,  there will then either be unused
                       black levels or some  will  be  used  more
                       than once.

                    ·  When  you  are  using values larger than 2
                       for BlackLevels or CMYLevels,  ghostscript
                       does  not discover by itself that it could
                       now achieve the same number of shades with
                       smaller halftone cells.

                    ·  Most   of   the  ways  of  increasing  the
                       halftone screen frequency  seem  to  fail.
                       I have been successful only with the some­
                       what pedestrian approach of using  thresh­
                       old  arrays, and even that worked only for
                       some cases.

                    ·  For  particular  CMYK  values   and   with
                       ghostscript   version 6   or  higher,  the
                       colour  becomes  drastically  wrong.   One
                       example  is  CMYK = (0.99998472, 0.002549,
                       0, 0.00367827); this should  be  almost  a
                       pure  cyan  but  is instead displayed as a
                       sort of pink.  If one subtracts  one  unit
                       in  the  last position for any of the non-
                       zero  components,   the   result   becomes
                       acceptable.   The  problem  has  not  been
                       observed with ghostscript 5.50.

                    ·  For ghostscript versions up to and includ­
                       ing  5.50,  if  you  are  using the colour
                       model CMYK and more than  2  black  levels
                       you   should   not  set  merely  a  single
                       halftone screen (setscreen, a type-1 or  a
                       type-3    halftone   dictionary)   because
                       ghostscript's  dithering  routine  can  in
                       this  case  return non-monotonic levels of
                       black  for  monotonic  input  intensities.
                       However,   if   you   specify  independent
                       halftone information for the colour compo­
                       nents,  gs uses a slower but more accurate
                       algorithm instead which does not  lead  to
                       the  wrong behaviour.  It is not necessary
                       for the halftone information to be differ­
                       ent  for  different  components to achieve
                       this.  Note that ghostscript installs sep­
                       arate halftone screens for CMYK devices by
                       default if the resolution is at least  150
                       ppi.

                 Whenever  you  modify  the  halftone screens you
                 should therefore use a test  file  like  levels-
                 test.ps   in  the  pcl3  distribution  to  check
                 whether you obtain the desired result.  In  par­
                 ticular, you should count the number of intensi­
                 ties you can distinguish for a single  colorant:
                 if  it  is  obviously not one plus the number of
                 pixels in the halftone cell times one less  than
                 the  number  of hardware intensity levels, some­
                 thing has gone wrong.  This is, for example, the
                 case  if  you specified 4 black levels and a 2×2
                 halftone cell, and you then can distinguish more
                 than  1 + 4×3 = 13 intensity levels.  You should
                 also watch for non-monotonic jumps in  intensity
                 and incompletely filled shapes.

                 The  value  Floyd-Steinberg selects Floyd-Stein­
                 berg error diffusion as the method for rendering
                 intensities.   Use this in particular for print­
                 ing photographs and other documents with a large
                 number  of  colours  or  small irregular shapes.
                 Regrettably, pcl3's speed is  much  slower  with
                 this  method than in the other cases, hence this
                 value should only be  used  when  it  is  really
                 needed   (e.g.,   when   you  run  into  one  of
                 ghostscript's halftoning problems) or  when  the
                 delay is acceptable.

                 If  you  are using ghostscript 5.50 and the page
                 to be rendered  needs  a  lot  of  memory  (this
                 applies  in  particular  to  Floyd-Steinberg  in
                 colour) a core dump  may  result  under  certain
                 circumstances.   You  can  get  around  this  by
                 increasing the MaxBitmap parameter or by switch­
                 ing to a newer ghostscript version.

       -dLeadingEdge=edge
                 This option can be used to specify which edge of
                 the sheet will enter  the  printer  first.   The
                 permitted values identify this edge by reference
                 to the orientation of default user space on  the
                 sheet   when   printing  with  default  settings
                 (except for LeadingEdge) and a page size  having
                 width  <=  height  ("canonical  page in portrait
                 orientation"):

                 null   No request for media orientation
                    0   Short edge; top of canonical page
                    1   Long edge; right side of  canoni­
                        cal page
                    2   Short  edge;  bottom of canonical
                        page
                    3   Long edge; left side of canonical
                        page

                 As  far  as  I  know,  given a particular PCL-3+
                 printer and a particular media size, you  cannot
                 choose  between  short  edge  first (0 or 2) and
                 long edge first (1 or 3):  this  orientation  is
                 prescribed  by  the  manufacturer  and should be
                 documented in  your  printer's  manual.   If  in
                 doubt,  use  short edge first when inserting the
                 medium.

                 The default value for edge is null.  This  leads
                 either  to  0  or to 3, depending on whether the
                 subdevice normally expects media of this size to
                 be fed short edge first or long edge first.  See
                 the subsection Media Sizes and  Orientations  in
                 the DESCRIPTION section above for details.

                 If  you  find  that you can't set this parameter
                 from PostScript but you can set it from the com­
                 mand  line,  ghostscript's setpagedevice defini­
                 tion probably does not  pass  the  parameter  to
                 drivers.   Read the gs-mods.txt file in the pcl3
                 distribution on how to fix this.

       -dManualFeed[=boolean]
                 It is possible to request a DeskJet  printer  to
                 wait  before  each  page of a document until the
                 Load/Eject button is  pressed  on  the  printer.
                 This  is intended for situations where some spe­
                 cial medium is used or  the  medium  has  to  be
                 inserted  into  an  input  slot holding only one
                 sheet at a time.  The default setting  for  this
                 option is false.

                 In PCL, manual feed is established by requesting
                 a particular media source (2), hence you  should
                 expect  that  setting this parameter will inter­
                 fere with the input tray selection via  InputAt­
                 tributes (see the Media Sources and Destinations
                 subsection in the CONFIGURATION section  below).

       -sMediaConfigurationFile=pathname
                 This  option  must specify an existing file con­
                 taining a list of supported media  sizes,  sheet
                 orientations  and  corresponding margin descrip­
                 tions for the printer.  This  will  take  prece­
                 dence over the builtin subdevice-specific lists.
                 The format of the file is described in the  CON­
                 FIGURATION  section  below.  This option is pri­
                 marily intended to be used with  the  subdevices
                 unspecold and unspec.

                 The  default is not to use a media configuration
                 file but the builtin lists.   However,  a  media
                 file  path can also be specified at compile time
                 overriding  the  default  behaviour  for  unspec
                 only.   Using  the MediaConfigurationFile option
                 in addition will take precedence over  the  com­
                 piled-in media file path.

       -dMediaPosition=position
                 This  option  sets  the standard PostScript page
                 device parameter MediaPosition to the  specified
                 value.  The integer position identifies an input
                 tray for feeding media from and must refer to an
                 existing entry in the InputAttributes dictionary
                 (see the Media Sources and Destinations  subsec­
                 tion  in  the  CONFIGURATION  section  below) in
                 order to take effect.  The media selection  pro­
                 cess will use this entry in preference to others
                 provided it  matches  the  media  request.   The
                 default  is  not to request a particular tray by
                 position but to look for a best match  based  on
                 other properties.  As ghostscript's default con­
                 figuration defines only one  entry  in  InputAt­
                 tributes  this  option is ineffective unless you
                 modify InputAttributes.

                 With current ghostscript versions you can't  use
                 this  parameter  to  select a negative position.
                 The driver will issue a warning if  you  attempt
                 it.   If  the  entry  is  actually  selected,  a
                 rangecheck error from ghostscript  will  follow.
                 This  restriction  applies  only  to this device
                 parameter, not to permissible values  for  posi­
                 tion  numbers in InputAttributes: if you want to
                 use a negative position, you can do so by making
                 sure  that  it  is the only matching entry or by
                 selecting it via Priority.

       -sMedium=medium
                 This option selects the type of medium you  wish
                 to  print on as far as the printer needs to know
                 about it.  The possible choices are:

                 0   plain paper
                 1   bond paper
                 2   HP Premium paper
                 3   glossy paper
                 4   transparency film
                 5   quick dry glossy
                 6   quick dry transparency

                 The default is plain paper.  For medium, you can
                 specify the full strings (these are the standard
                 values), the (in some  cases)  one-word  strings
                 resulting  from  dropping  "paper",  "film", and
                 "HP", or  an  integer.   Out-of-range  numerical
                 values generate a warning but are passed through
                 to the printer if you are using a group-3 subde­
                 vice.   If  you don't, the effect is the same as
                 specifying plain paper.  The values 5 and 6  are
                 unknown  to  most  DeskJets;  the  only official
                 exception I know of is  the  HP  2000C  printer.
                 Your  printer's  manual  should  tell  you which
                 kinds of medium are supported.

       -dOnlyCRD[=boolean]
                 This parameter influences the PCL code generated
                 and   should   only  be  specified  for  group-3
                 DeskJets.  The default value is false and  leads
                 to  the  new  PCL  command Configure Raster Data
                 being used only when it is necessary.   Specify­
                 ing  true  leads  to Configure Raster Data being
                 used even in those cases  where  older  commands
                 would be sufficient.

                 There  are  indications that printers with a PCL
                 dialect of "PCL Level 3 enhanced" need  a  value
                 of  true for this option to enable some of their
                 functionality.

       -sPageCountFile=pathname
                 The pathname must specify either a  non-existent
                 file  in  a directory with write permission or a
                 writable file with a single  line  containing  a
                 non-negative  integer.   In the first case, pcl3
                 will create the file and insert  the  number  of
                 pages  printed,  in  the  second case the number
                 will be incremented by  that  amount.   Parallel
                 invocations  of gs are permitted to use the same
                 file.  pcl3 will  also  make  the  initial  page
                 count available in its page device dictionary.

                 This option is mainly intended for spooler back­
                 ends calling pcl3.  It can be used to keep track
                 of  the  total  number of pages printed and also
                 for per-job accounting.  I recommend using  this
                 option  for the first purpose and to make a note
                 of the values in the  resulting  files  whenever
                 you  insert  a  new  ink  cartridge.   This will
                 enable you to get an indication of  how  much  a
                 printed  page  costs, and hence why it is a good
                 idea to use draft quality whenever possible  and
                 why you should have bought a laser printer.

                 The  driver  can be compiled without this option
                 present but on a UNIX system I would not  expect
                 this  to be done unless gs offers the same func­
                 tionality in a driver-independent  manner  which
                 it currently does not.

                 pcl3  is  distributed with example files if-pcl3
                 and cups-pcl3 of Berkeley and CUPS spooler back­
                 ends using this option.

       -sPCLInit1=string and -sPCLInit2=string
                 These  options  can be used to insert additional
                 PCL commands into pcl3's output.  Strings  given
                 to  PCLInit1  will be sent immediately after the
                 initial Printer  Reset  command,  the  value  of
                 PCLInit2  will  be  emitted  shortly  before the
                 raster data of the first page.  The  default  is
                 not to send any additional commands.

                 Don't use any of these options unless you under­
                 stand PCL or someone who does  tells  you  which
                 value to choose under which circumstances.

                 Because  not  every possible string value can be
                 passed from the command line,  these  parameters
                 are best set from a PostScript file.

       -sPJLJob=[jobname]
                 This  option  can be used to surround the gener­
                 ated file with Printer Job Language  (PJL)  com­
                 mands  declaring  it  to  be  a single print job
                 called jobname.  If you omit jobname, you create
                 an unnamed job.  The string jobname may not con­
                 tain double quotes or control characters  except
                 HT  (the  forbidden  byte  codes  are 0 to 8, 10
                 to 31, and 34).

                 Use this option if your printer understands  PJL
                 and  you  discover  either that settings for one
                 job influence the  following  job  or  that  the
                 printer  does  not  recognize the end of the job
                 (lights remain flashing or a control panel still
                 displays a processing message).  If you send the
                 generated PCL file through a PJL filter, in par­
                 ticular  one  querying the printer's state, omit
                 this option and use the filter for this  purpose
                 instead.

       -sPJLLanguage=language
                 If  a printer supports several command languages
                 and PCL 3+ is not the default, the printer  must
                 be  told to switch to PCL 3+ at the beginning of
                 the print job.  Hewlett-Packard's printers use a
                 Printer Job Language (PJL) command for this pur­
                 pose.  Specifying this option  will  switch  the
                 printer  to language for the duration of the job
                 and back to the default at the end.

                 This option is not usually necessary except that
                 there  are  indications that printers with a PCL
                 dialect of "PCL Level 3 enhanced" need -sPJLLan­
                 guage=PCL3GUI  to enable some of their function­
                 ality.

                 You should never use the option unless you  have
                 a  reliable  source  for  the values of language
                 accepted by your printer, for example the output
                 from  pcl3opts  for a file generated by an offi­
                 cial driver for the printer in question.  Values
                 I have seen so far are PCLSLEEK and PCL3GUI.

                 If you send the generated PCL file through a PJL
                 filter, omit this option and use the filter  for
                 this purpose instead.

       -sPrintQuality=quality
                 There are three print quality settings:

                 -1   draft or econo
                  0   normal
                  1   presentation or best

                 The  default  is  normal.   You  may specify the
                 strings or an integer.   Out-of-range  numerical
                 values  will  generate  a warning but are passed
                 through to the printer if you  have  selected  a
                 group-3  subdevice.   If you haven't, the effect
                 is the same as specifying normal.

       -dRasterGraphicsQuality=quality
                 This option is only available for  old  DeskJets
                 (including  unspecold)  and controls a trade-off
                 between quality and print speed.   The  possible
                 values for quality are:

                 0   Use current control panel setting

                 1   Draft
                 2   High

                 Specifying  this  option  overrides  the default
                 value derived from Medium and PrintQuality.

       -dSendBlackLast[=boolean]
                 When printing with four inks, a  PCL-3+  printer
                 expects the colour information for a row of pix­
                 els in  the  order  black,  cyan,  magenta,  and
                 finally yellow (KCMY).

                 There  exists  at  least  one  printer (Olivetti
                 JP792) which claims to accept PCL 3+ but expects
                 the  colour  planes to arrive in the order CMYK.
                 If you have a printer with  this  property,  use
                 this option.  The default value is false.

       -dSendNULs=number
                 Most  HP drivers for newer DeskJet printers gen­
                 erate PCL files starting with a sequence of  600
                 NUL  characters,  at  least  one  uses even 9600
                 NULs.  I have seen no documentation of this fea­
                 ture  but I assume that in PCL the NUL character
                 demands a null operation,  i.e.,  does  nothing.
                 Just in case such a NUL sequence is useful under
                 certain circumstances, this option can  be  used
                 to request it.  (It has been suggested that this
                 is needed to get the printer to accept  new  PCL
                 commands  if  the previous print job was aborted
                 in the middle of a command.)  The  value  number
                 specifies  the  number of NUL characters to send
                 and must not be negative.  The default is  zero.
                 Note  that  initial  NULs  might confuse spooler
                 backends which try to determine  the  file  type
                 from the first few bytes of the file contents.

                 There  is  no point in using this option if some
                 other command in your print  pipeline  will  add
                 Printer  Job  Language  (PJL)  commands  to  the
                 pcl3-generated file.

       -dShingling=shingling
                 This  option  is  only  available  for   group-2
                 DeskJets  (including unspecold) and controls the
                 number of passes the print head makes  over  the
                 medium.  A higher number permits more neighbour­
                 ing pixels to be  printed  in  separate  passes,
                 thereby  reducing  the  likelihood  of  the  ink
                 spreading into the  next  pixel.   The  possible
                 values for shingling are:

                 0   No shingling
                 1   2 passes (50% each pass)
                 2   4 passes (25% each pass)

                 Specifying  this  option  overrides  the default
                 value derived from Medium and PrintQuality.

       -sSubdevice=subdevice
                 This option identifies  the  printer  model  for
                 which  the generated file is intended.  The fol­
                 lowing names (mostly of Hewlett-Packard  DeskJet
                 printers) are accepted for subdevice:


                        hpdj,  hpdjplus,  hpdjportable,  hpdj310,
                        hpdj320,   hpdj340,   hpdj400,   hpdj500,
                        hpdj500c,   hpdj510,   hpdj520,  hpdj540,
                        hpdj550c, hpdj560c,  unspecold,  hpdj600,
                        hpdj660c,  hpdj670c,  hpdj680c, hpdj690c,
                        hpdj850c, hpdj855c,  hpdj870c,  hpdj890c,
                        hpdj1120c, unspec.

                 The  correspondence  with  the real printer name
                 is, I hope, obvious.  Note that  hpdj  does  not
                 select  the hpdj driver (this driver's predeces­
                 sor) but configures  the  pcl3  driver  for  the
                 "classical" HP DeskJet.

                 With   the   exception   of   hpdj,  unspec  and
                 unspecold, your gs binary might support the sub­
                 device names also as device names, i.e., instead
                 of specifying  -sDEVICE=pcl3  -sSubdevice=subde­
                 vice  you might be able to write -sDEVICE=subde­
                 vice.  Check  ghostscript's  list  of  available
                 devices to find out whether this is the case (gs
                 -h).

                 The choice  of  subdevice  primarily  determines
                 which resolutions, colour models, intensity lev­
                 els and media  sizes  the  driver  will  accept,
                 where the output will appear on the page, and to
                 some extent what PCL code the driver will gener­
                 ate.   Several  of  the  subdevices  are treated
                 identically.

                 The default subdevice is unspec.  It is intended
                 for new PCL-3+ printers not explicitly supported
                 by this driver.  For unspec, all  subdevice-spe­
                 cific  checks  (e.g., supported resolutions) are
                 turned off.  Supported media  sizes  and  margin
                 settings  are assumed to be identical with those
                 for the DeskJets  850C/855C/870C/890C,  but  you
                 can  and  should  use the MediaConfigurationFile
                 option or its compile-time equivalent  to  over­
                 ride this.  The PCL code generated assumes a new
                 DeskJet in the sense that it should be at  least
                 of the level of a DeskJet 540 supporting the PCL
                 commands Media Type and Print Quality.   If  you
                 specify  unequal horizontal and vertical resolu­
                 tions or more than two levels of  intensity  per
                 colorant and pixel, the printer must in addition
                 understand the Configure Raster Data command.

                 The subdevice unspecold is similar  but  behaves
                 like  a  DeskJet  560C.   It supports all colour
                 models and all uniform resolutions (the horizon­
                 tal  resolution is equal to the vertical resolu­
                 tion).

                 If you choose to use unspec or unspecold  it  is
                 your  responsibility to ensure that pcl3 is only
                 called with parameter  values  the  printer  can
                 handle.  This applies in particular to the reso­
                 lution and the intensity levels.

                 If you set this parameter from a PostScript doc­
                 ument  you must know that doing this re-initial­
                 izes  most  of  the  pcl3  parameters  to  their
                 default  values.  If you set several page device
                 parameters in a single  setpagedevice  call  the
                 Subdevice option will be treated first.

       -dTumble[=boolean]
                 When  duplex  printing  is requested (-dDuplex),
                 this parameter specifies whether the y  axes  of
                 PostScript's default user space on the two sides
                 of the sheet (assumed to use the same page size)
                 point  to  the  same  edge or to opposite edges.
                 The default value false indicates the same  edge
                 and  is usually suitable for binding on the left
                 while true indicates opposite edges  and  should
                 be used for binding at the top.

                 You  should note that the interpretation of Tum­
                 ble  refers  to  default  user   space:   if   a
                 PostScript  program  has  rotated the user space
                 coordinate system the  association  between  the
                 page's  apparent  "up" direction and the binding
                 edge will usually not be the one  desired.   You
                 should  watch for this in particular when creat­
                 ing output  in  landscape  orientation  from  an
                 application  still generating PostScript Level 1
                 code.  If a ghostscript screen driver  like  x11
                 displays  the  pages  with the right side up you
                 should have nothing to worry about, even in  the
                 case  of  landscape orientation.  (You must call
                 gs directly for this test, not  via  ghostview.)
                 If  the  orientation between the two sides turns
                 out to be wrong, you will have  to  print  again
                 with  the  opposite  value  for Tumble.  If that
                 does not help and you have a printer  supporting
                 only  one  of  the  two possible duplex orienta­
                 tions, check the relative order of  restore  and
                 showpage  in  the  document you printed (see the
                 DuplexCapability option above).

       -dUseCard[=value]
                 This option should only be given  when  printing
                 on  A6  and  with  a printer like the HP DeskJet
                 1120C which distinguishes between A6 sheets  and
                 A6 postcards.  The option can be used to specif­
                 ically request one  of  the  alternatives.   The
                 default  value is null and means that sheets are
                 preferred to postcards, but either is acceptable
                 if  supported.   The  other permitted values are
                 true and false.

                 This option applies to all page sizes set  while
                 ghostscript   executes  and  this  includes  the
                 default size set at startup.  If you wish to use
                 -dUseCard=true  you  will therefore usually have
                 to specify the PAPERSIZE  option  in  the  call,
                 otherwise  an  error will occur because there is
                 no postcard variant for the usual default  sizes
                 (ISO A4 and US Letter).

   Option Combinations for Hardware Parameters
       Not  all  combinations of colour model, resolution, number
       of intensity levels, print  quality  and  media  type  are
       accepted  or  make  sense.  Unfortunately, Hewlett-Packard
       does not publicly release sufficient information  to  find
       the  best  possible combinations.  A good way to find rea­
       sonable settings is to use pcl3opts on files generated  by
       an official driver for the printer.  You should also check
       the file reports.txt in the pcl3 distribution.   In  addi­
       tion, I'll provide some remarks here.

       As a general rule, it is unprofitable to use a finer reso­
       lution than 300 ppi or more than 2  intensity  levels  for
       draft  quality.   A  coarser  resolution in particular can
       reduce the time needed to generate and transmit  the  file
       to the printer.  Combined with draft quality this leads to
       what HP calls an "EconoFast" mode.

       As an exception, here are recommendations based  on  offi­
       cial  HP  documentation  for the DeskJet 1120C.  The table
       lists the resolution and the number of black or black  and
       CMY levels if not 2.

              Quality        Gray                CMYK
              ---------------------------------------------------------
              draft          300 ppi             300 ppi
              normal         300 ppi, 4 levels   300 ppi, (4,3) levels
              presentation   600 ppi             300 ppi, (4,4) levels

       These  seem reasonable values for the supported series-800
       DeskJets as well.

   Checking Page Device Parameters
       As  for  all  ghostscript  drivers,  pcl3's  command  line
       options  correspond  to  identically-named PostScript page
       device parameters and are accessible in the usual way.  In
       particular,  it is possible to read the value of a parame­
       ter by letting gs execute a command like


              currentpagedevice /parameter get ==

       where parameter is the name of  the  parameter  one  would
       like  to inspect, for example BlackLevels.  This is useful
       if you are in doubt whether the driver has  accepted  your
       options.   Of  course,  for printer-visible parameters you
       can also use pcl3opts on the output file.

       The ghostscript distribution contains a program  uninfo.ps
       which displays the page device dictionary on standard out­
       put but does not resolve nested  dictionaries.   The  pcl3
       distribution  contains  a similar program dumppdd.ps which
       does not have this limitation.

CONFIGURATION
   Media Configuration File
       A media configuration file (media file for short)  can  be
       used  to  override the builtin subdevice-specific lists of
       supported media sizes and, for each size, the sheet orien­
       tation  in  the input tray and the margins enforced by the
       printer.  This feature is mainly intended to  be  used  in
       conjunction with unspec and unspecold: if you have a model
       not directly supported by this driver, look  up  the  sup­
       ported  media sizes, the rules for inserting media and the
       corresponding printable regions in your  printer's  manual
       and enter them in a media file.

              Caution:

              Entering  a  media  size  in  the file which is not
              really supported by your printer is not useful: the
              PCL  interpreter  will simply ignore the request to
              set this size, and  printer  and  driver  may  have
              diverging  opinions about what the margins will be.
              If you need to print on a medium of a size not sup­
              ported   by  your  printer,  choose  a  larger  and
              printer-supported size in PostScript or via  FIXED­
              MEDIA,  shift  the  image  if  necessary, establish
              properly-positioned  clipping  regions  within  the
              real  size, and print.  Or you could use a suitable
              page size recovery policy  for  PostScript's  media
              selection  process.   However,  if you have a newer
              DeskJet supporting custom page sizes, all  this  is
              not necessary.

       Margin  specifications  are important for two reasons: the
       values for the left and top margins determine how the out­
       put is positioned on the page, and sufficiently large val­
       ues for the right and bottom  margins  prevent  the  print
       head  being caught at the paper's edge and printing beyond
       the sheet, respectively.  Because DeskJet printers usually
       have   an  inconveniently  large  bottom  margin  (usually
       0.4-0.8 inches or 10-20 mm), one might be tempted to spec­
       ify  smaller  values  than listed in the printer's manual.
       However, one user reported that this led  to  the  printer
       depositing  a large wet blob of black ink at the bottom of
       the page.

       A line in the media file can  be  blank,  a  comment  line
       (first  non-blank character is '#'), or one of the follow­
       ing:

              unit   unit
              size   left bottom  right top

       A unit line specifies in which units margin specifications
       in  the  following  lines should be interpreted.  unit can
       either be in (inch) or mm (millimetre) with in  being  the
       default.   A  unit  specification  remains  in force until
       overridden by a following unit line.

       The second kind of line states that the model  supports  a
       particular  media configuration and specifies the hardware
       margins in force for that case.  The size word consists of
       two  parts:  a  keyword  denoting  the  extension  and  an
       optional suffix.   The  following  keywords  are  accepted
       (entries marked with an asterisk (*) are those used by the
       subdevice unspec if no media  file  is  employed;  entries
       with  a  section/paragraph sign (§) similarly identify the
       sizes used by unspecold):

       Note the difference between A6 (sheet) and  A6Card  (post­
       card).   I do not know why Hewlett-Packard associates this
       distinction with media size instead of media  type.   How­
       ever, with the exception of the 1120C all DeskJet printers
       I know of use only A6Card anyway.

       In looking at your printer's documentation, bear  in  mind
       that  a  driver  might support more sizes than the printer
       accepts; pcl3 needs to be given the latter values.  If you
       are  in  doubt what your printer understands, pcl3opts can
       tell you which media size another driver requests.

       Custom page sizes are not understood by older printers and
       may  be  used  in  a  media  file  only for the subdevices
       hpdj540,  hpdj6nn[c],  hpdj8nnc,  hpdj1120c,  and   unspec
       (group 3).   In  these cases you can print, within certain
       limits, on  arbitrarily-sized  media.   The  driver  knows
       these  limits and refuses to generate a file if you exceed
       them.  For unspec, there are no limits.   pcl3  will  tell
       the  printer to expect a custom page size only if there is
       no fitting discrete entry.

       Although it is possible, on those printers  which  support
       it,  to  use  a media configuration file containing only a
       custom page size entry, I advise against it  because  this
       size  specification is only intended as a last resort.  If
       you have a custom page size entry in the media  file,  you
       should therefore list all discrete sizes supported by your
       printer or at least those which you expect to use.

       The size keyword in the size field can be extended by  the
       following strings:

       Big       For pcl3, this suffix means banner printing.  In
                 these cases the top and bottom margins are  usu­
                 ally zero.  HP DeskJets supporting banner print­
                 ing do so only for ISO A4 and US  Letter.   Your
                 media  file  should then contain entries for the
                 sizes A4, A4Big, Letter, and LetterBig.

       .Transverse
                 By default, pcl3 assumes that the  media  listed
                 are  fed  short edge first.  If you specify this
                 qualifier, the driver will assume that  you  are
                 going  to  feed  media  of  this  size long edge
                 first.  If, for example, your  printer's  manual
                 states  that  envelopes of size ISO DL should be
                 fed long  edge  first,  the  corresponding  size
                 field  in  your  media  file  should contain the
                 string EnvDL.Transverse, not EnvDL.

                 This specification (or its absence) can be over­
                 ridden  with the option LeadingEdge in the call.

       The builtin lists for the unspec and unspecold devices  do
       not contain size entries with any of these suffixes.

       Every media file must contain at least an entry which fits
       ghostscript's default page size, usually ISO A4 or US Let­
       ter.   Only  those sizes which are listed will be accepted
       by pcl3.  This is independent of a .Transverse suffix.  If
       there  are several entries in the media file with the same
       size value, only the first is used.

       The margins in a size entry should be valid for monochrome
       printing  in  raster  graphics  mode.  If a non-monochrome
       colour model is selected and unless the bottom  margin  is
       exactly zero, it will be increased by a subdevice-specific
       amount.  This increment is zero for unspecold and  unspec.

       The  orientation  of  the  margins  refers  to the feeding
       direction: you should imagine holding the sheet such  that
       the  leading edge is at the top and the side to be printed
       on is towards  you.   Be  careful  with  envelopes:  older
       (pre-1997)  HP  documentation usually gives the margins in
       landscape orientation even for those  printers  where  the
       envelope  has  to  be fed short edge first.  You can check
       this by looking for the largest margin value: if it is  on
       the  left  instead  of  at the bottom you almost certainly
       have such a landscape-based specification; rotate the val­
       ues  by  +90  degrees (quarter-circle counterclockwise) in
       these cases.  The margins have to be specified as non-neg­
       ative  floating  point numbers in inches or millimetres as
       announced by the last preceding unit line.   The  floating
       point format is that of the "C" locale.

       pcl3  is distributed with an example of a media configura­
       tion file, example.mcf.

   PostScript Configuration Files
       Sometimes it is desirable to execute additional PostScript
       commands  for a particular file or possibly all files sent
       to a particular printer or print queue.  With  ghostscript
       this  is  easily  possible because gs accepts several file
       names in the invocation and processes  them  sequentially.
       This  is  particularly  appropriate  for  those PostScript
       operators which affect device-specific features and should
       therefore  not  appear  in a portable page description and
       for settings which would be part of the interpreter's per­
       sistent state when using a real PostScript printer.

       The pcl3 distribution contains examples of filters if-pcl3
       for the Berkeley spooler lpr(1) and cups-pcl3 for the Com­
       mon  UNIX  Printing System cupsd(8).  These filters permit
       the use of a print-queue-specific configuration file.

   Media Sources and Destinations
       PostScript has a builtin  mechanism  for  selecting  media
       sources  and  destinations  based on certain properties of
       the document.  This usually requires a system  administra­
       tor  to  set the InputAttributes and OutputAttributes dic­
       tionaries in the device's page device dictionary according
       to  the current state of the printer and its intended use.
       For example, if there are two input trays,  one  currently
       holding  paper  and the other transparencies, the adminis­
       trator could configure the InputAttributes dictionary such
       that  print  jobs  requesting  transparencies in a certain
       manner automatically fetch media from the second tray  and
       every job needing a size not currently available will ter­
       minate with an error message.  Unfortunately, in order  to
       work  as  expected this process usually also requires some
       additional action on the part of the entity generating the
       PostScript code to be printed.

       If  your  printer is capable of sensing certain properties
       of media in the input tray (e.g., media size) or assumes a
       fixed association between media properties and input trays
       you must expect this functionality to interfere  with  the
       process referenced here.

       In the attributes dictionaries, each tray is identified by
       an integer, its position number.   When  ghostscript  suc­
       cessfully  matches  the document's requirements with trays
       the resulting  position  numbers  are  accessible  to  the
       driver.   The  pcl3  driver  uses these numbers (except 0)
       directly as arguments for the PCL commands "Media  Source"
       and  "Media  Destination",  respectively.   For  the Media
       Source values (input trays), I know of the following mean­
       ings:


              -1   banner printing
               1   default tray; portable
                   CSF (DJ 340);  tray  2
                   (HP 2500C)
               2   manual feed
               3   envelope feed
               4   desktop  CSF (DJ 340);
                   tray 3 (HP 2500C)
               5   tray 1 (HP 2500C)
               7   auto select (HP 2500C)

       You'll have to experiment with your printer  to  find  out
       which  values  are  accepted and what their interpretation
       is.  In general, you can only expect  1  and  2  to  work.
       Unrecognized  values  should  be  simply  ignored  by  the
       printer leading to  the  medium  being  fetched  from  the
       default  tray.  To shorten the search, use pcl3opts if you
       can in order to find out which values other drivers gener­
       ate.   Don't bother testing the value 0: in PCL its effect
       is to eject a page and, as this is not needed,  pcl3  uses
       it to mean that no particular tray should be selected.

       I  do  not know of any PCL-3+ printer supporting more than
       one output tray, hence the corresponding implementation is
       based  on  the  speculation  that  such a feature, if made
       available, would use the same command as in PCL 5.  Again,
       a  value  of  zero is used by pcl3 to mean "don't select a
       particular tray".

       Ghostscript's  default  configuration   defines   InputAt­
       tributes  and OutputAttributes dictionaries with one entry
       each, having position number 0 in both cases, and maps all
       requests  to  these  positions.   As explained above, this
       configuration will lead to pcl3 not requesting any partic­
       ular input or output tray.  If you wish to modify this you
       should consult a PostScript manual, for example  the  sec­
       tions  6.2.1  and  6.2.4 in the PostScript Language Refer­
       ence.  However, I'll present here three  examples  without
       explanation.   In  all  cases,  the  PostScript code shown
       should be executed before the document to be printed.

       The first example is intended  for  situations  where  you
       always wish to select a specific input tray:


              <<
                /InputAttributes <<
                  0 null
                  input << /PageSize [6 6 524287 524287] >>
                >>
              >> setpagedevice

       Replace input with the number of the tray you wish to use.
       The second example does the same for the output tray:


              <<
                /OutputAttributes <<
                  0 null
                  output << >>
                >>
              >> setpagedevice

       Replace output with the number of the  tray  you  wish  to
       use.

       For the final example assume that you have one input tray,
       filled with media of a certain default size, and you  wish
       all  print  jobs  requesting another size to automatically
       switch to manual feed so  you  can  insert  these  special
       sheets  at leisure.  In that case, let gs execute the fol­
       lowing PostScript code:


              <<
                /InputAttributes <<
                  0 << /PageSize [width height] >>
                  2 << /PageSize [6 6 524287 524287] >>
                  /Priority [0 2]
                >>
              >> setpagedevice


       For width and height you must insert the actual dimensions
       of  your  default size in units of 1 bp ("big point", 1/72
       inch, roughly 0.35 mm); the tolerance is 5  bp.   In  con­
       trast to a document's page size, the orientation is irrel­
       evant here.

       If you drop the second entry and the Priority line in  the
       last  example you obtain a configuration where ghostscript
       will refuse to print any document not requesting the spec­
       ified media size.  If you retain the two lines and you are
       using the unspecold or unspec devices it is  advisable  to
       insert  your printer's actual size bounds instead of those
       given above.  This will protect you  against  printing  on
       some sizes not supported by your printer.

   Banner Printing
       Some  printers  support printing on continuous forms, also
       called banners or z-fold  media.   Your  printer's  manual
       should  tell you whether this is supported and in particu­
       lar how to load these media.

       In order to print on continuous media with pcl3, configure
       it as follows:

          ·  Make  sure  that  input  position  number -1 will be
             selected (see the subsection Media Sources And  Des­
             tinations above).

          ·  In the call to gs, select a subdevice supporting the
             intended "Big" size.  By default,  only  the  subde­
             vices  hpdj680c, hpdj690c and hpdj1120c support ban­
             ner printing (A4Big and LetterBig).

       Don't forget to prepare the printer as well.

   Correcting Offsets
       A media configuration file is intended to  adapt  pcl3  to
       the  difference  in margin settings between printer models
       and should usually contain "official" information, prefer­
       ably taken from the model's manual.

       A  different  situation  arises  if a particular printer's
       output is not properly positioned on the page even if  the
       margin  information is correct for this model.  PostScript
       defines two arrays in the page device dictionary for  cor­
       recting  such  misadjustments, both containing two numbers
       describing a desired shift of the page image with  respect
       to  device  space  coordinate axes but in different units.
       The values in the `Margins'  array  are  interpreted  with
       respect  to  a  canonical  default  resolution,  the newer
       `PageOffset' array is taken to be in units  of  1/72  inch
       ("big points", bp).  For pcl3 the device coordinate system
       has an x axis pointing to the right and a y axis  pointing
       downwards  when looking at the sheet with the leading edge
       at the top and the side to be printed on towards you.  The
       canonical default resolution is 300 ppi.

       As  an example, assume your printer shifts its output 1 mm
       to the right and 0.5 mm upwards.  Now create a  file  con­
       taining either the PostScript code


              << /Margins [-11.8 5.9] >> setpagedevice

       ("shift 11.8 pixels to the left and 5.9 pixels down") or


              << /PageOffset [-2.8 1.4] >> setpagedevice

       ("shift  2.8  bp to the left and 1.4 bp down") and have it
       executed by ghostscript before the file to be printed.

       The margin test files distributed with pcl3 can be used to
       determine  the  necessary correction.  You should be aware
       that you have to expect  fluctuations  between  individual
       print jobs, in particular in the horizontal direction.

   Transfer Functions
       DeskJets  usually  produce  prints which are too dark (too
       much ink on the page), most  noticeably  when  using  more
       than  2  intensity  levels per colorant.  In this case you
       should  perform  gamma  correction   by   modifying   what
       PostScript  calls  transfer  functions.   In  the simplest
       case, create a file containing the PostScript command


              {number exp} settransfer


       where a good value for number  is  usually  in  the  range
       0.3-0.5,  and  specify  this file in ghostscript's command
       line before the file you wish to print.  Now the  intensi­
       ties  of  all colorants will be rescaled by exponentiation
       with number.  Because PostScript intensity values  are  in
       the range zero to one with zero meaning dark and one mean­
       ing light (additive interpretation), a value of number < 1
       will  lead  to  lighter  colours and number > 1 results in
       darker colours.

       The best value for number depends on  the  print  quality,
       the  number  of  intensity  levels,  the method chosen for
       intensity rendering, the kind of medium you print on,  and
       the properties of the document to be printed.

       Note  that there is no common convention for the interpre­
       tation of stand-alone gamma  values.   When  dealing  with
       other  software you might for example find that the bound­
       ary between light and dark is at a value of 1000 and  that
       lighter colours are obtained with larger values.  In order
       to understand what a "gamma  value"  means  you  therefore
       need  the  complete specification of the transfer function
       and, if the value  does  not  refer  to  PostScript,  also
       information on the interpretation of intensity values.

       You  can  also  set independent transfer functions for the
       four colorants  by  using  the  operator  setcolortransfer
       which  expects  four  routines  as  arguments.   Consult a
       PostScript manual if you want to learn more about transfer
       functions.

       If you are using -sIntensityRendering=halftones, less than
       32 intensity levels per colorant, a resolution  below  800
       ppi,  and unless you explicitly set transfer functions, gs
       applies a default gamma correction  roughly  corresponding
       to a value of 0.8 for number.

LIMITATIONS
   Ghostscript Version
       This  manual  page  contains statements relying on undocu­
       mented properties of ghostscript.  These statements are to
       my   best   knowledge   and  belief  correct  for  current
       ghostscript versions but I do not check all  these  state­
       ments for every new version.

       If you are in doubt about a particular point, please check
       it yourself.

   Reliability
       Hewlett-Packard does  not  publicly  provide  sufficiently
       detailed  or  accurate  technical  information  to write a
       reliable driver for  all  of  its  PCL-3+  printers.   The
       amount   and  quality  of  available  information  differs
       between printer models.  As  a  consequence,  pcl3  cannot
       provide  the  same  level  of  reliability  for all of its
       devices.

       In my opinion the best-documented printers  are  those  of
       the  DeskJet-500  series.   In  addition, I have currently
       access to a DeskJet 850C which I have used for a number of
       experiments.  Support for these printers should be consid­
       ered to be the most reliable.

       The next level of reliability  belongs  to  the  remaining
       printers for which subdevices exist.  In these cases I had
       at least access to official HP documentation on  supported
       media  sizes  and associated hardware margins and in addi­
       tion for almost all cases some  information  on  the  sup­
       ported  PCL  commands, sometimes complemented by PCL files
       generated by HP's official drivers and sent me by users.

       The third level of reliability is  associated  with  those
       printers  for  which  people have sent success reports but
       for which I have no official information from HP.

       With decreasing reliability it becomes increasingly proba­
       ble  that  there  is  printer  functionality  which is not
       accessible through pcl3 or even that this driver generates
       PCL code not accepted by the printer.

   Mixed Resolutions
       Some printers are able to print with different resolutions
       for black and CMY on the same region of a page.  For exam­
       ple,  the  best quality on a DeskJet 850C is achieved with
       600 ppi for black and 300 ppi for CMY.  This is  not  sup­
       ported by pcl3.

   Photo Cartridges
       From  what  I've  heard,  DeskJet printers with photo car­
       tridges installed do not use a CMYK  palette  but  instead
       one  with 6 components.  I have no official information on
       this interface and even if I had it wouldn't help  because
       ghostscript does not currently support DeviceN as a native
       colour space.

   Cartridge Alignment
       DeskJet printers with more than one ink cartridge  present
       should  usually  be  configured  for  the  proper relative
       alignment of these cartridges.  Apparently, this  informa­
       tion  is  stored in not-immediately-volatile memory in the
       printer together with  some  settings  (like  the  default
       media size) which are not relevant for printing with pcl3.
       As I do not have information on how this is done, you will
       need to use one of HP's programs for this purpose.

       On  a  Linux  system,  try installing and running HP's DOS
       DeskJet control panel DJCP  in  the  DOS  emulator.   DJCP
       should  be  present  on  one of the installation media you
       received with your printer.  One user managed to get  this
       to work for a DJ 670C with DOSEMU 0.98 under RedHat 5.2 by
       setting


              $_ports = "0x378 0x379"

       in dosemu.conf.  I was not successful on my Debian system.

       The  pcl3 distribution contains a file calign.ps which you
       can print if you wish to check to which  extent  the  car­
       tridges are aligned.

KNOWN BUGS
       There are no known bugs in pcl3 proper, but there do exist
       restrictions or bugs  in  gs  which  can  lead  to  faulty
       behaviour  when  printing  with pcl3.  As far as I noticed
       them they are mentioned in the body of this manual page at
       the relevant points.

       You  can  find  an up-to-date bug list for this driver via
       pcl3's home page on the Web.
