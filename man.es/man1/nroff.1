NROFF(1)                                                 NROFF(1)



NAME
       nroff - emulate nroff command with groff

SYNOPSIS
       nroff [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -mname ] [ -nnum ] [ -olist ] [ -p ]
             [ -rcn ] [ -t ] [ -S ] [ -Tname ] [ -U ] [ -v ]
             [ file... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  nroff  script emulates the nroff command using groff.
       Only ascii, koi8-r, latin1, utf8,  and  cp1047  are  valid
       arguments  for  the  -T  option.   If  an invalid or no -T
       option is given, nroff checks the current locale to select
       a  default  output device.  It first tries the locale pro­
       gram, then the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and
       LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET environment variable.

       The  -h  option  is  equivalent  to the grotty's -h option
       (i.e., using tabs in the output).  The -i, -n, -m, -o  and
       -r  options  have  the  effect  described in troff(1).  In
       addition, nroff silently ignores the options -e,  -q,  and
       -s  (which  are  not  implemented  in  troff).  Options -p
       (pic), -t (tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to
       groff.   -S  is  passed  by default.  -v shows the version
       number.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in  which  to
              search for the groff executable before searching in
              PATH.  If unset, `/usr/bin' is used.

NOTES
       This shell script  is  basically  intended  for  use  with
       man(1), so warnings are suppressed.  nroff-style character
       definitions (in the file tty-char.tmac) are also loaded to
       emulate unrepresentable glyphs.
