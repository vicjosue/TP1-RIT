       directly to UNIX tape drives

SYNOPSIS

       [ -d directory ]  [ -u user ]  [ -t tape ]  [ -t tape ]  [

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       smbtar is a very small shell script on top of smbclient(1)
       which dumps SMB shares directly to tape.

OPTIONS
       -s server
              The SMB/CIFS server that the share resides upon.

       -x service
              The share name on the server to  connect  to.   The
              default is "backup".

       -X     Exclude  mode. Exclude filenames... from tar create
              or restore.

       -d directory
              Change to  initial  directory  before  restoring  /
              backing up files.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -p password
              The  password  to  use to access a share.  Default:
              none

       -u user
              The user id to  connect  as.  Default:  UNIX  login
              name.

       -t tape
              Tape  device.  May  be regular file or tape device.
              Default: $TAPE environmental variable; if not  set,
              a file called tar.out .

       -b blocksize
              Blocking  factor.  Defaults to 20. See tar(1) for a
              fuller explanation.

       -N filename
              Backup only files newer  than  filename.  Could  be
              used  (for  example)  on  a  log  file to implement
              incremental backups.

       -i     Incremental mode; tar files are only backed  up  if
              they  have  the archive bit set. The archive bit is
              reset after each file is read.

       -r     Restore. Files are restored to the share  from  the
              tar file.

       -l log level
              Log  (debug)  level.  Corresponds to the -d flag of
              smbclient(1) .

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The $TAPE variable specifies the default  tape  device  to
       write to. May be overridden with the -t option.

BUGS
       The  smbtar script has different options from ordinary tar
       and tar called from smbclient.

CAVEATS
       Sites that are more careful about security  may  not  like
       the  way  the  script  handles  PC  passwords.  Backup and
       restore work on entire shares, should work on file  lists.
       smbtar  works best with GNU tar and may not work well with
       other versions.

DIAGNOSTICS
       See the DIAGNOSTICS section for the smbclient(1)  command.

VERSION
       This  man  page  is  correct  for version 2.2 of the Samba
       suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       Ricky Poulten <URL:mailto:poultenr@logica.co.uk> wrote the
       tar extension and this man page.  The  smbtar  script  was
       heavily   rewritten   and   improved   by  Martin  Kraemer
       <URL:mailto:Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>.  Many  thanks   to
       everyone   who  suggested  extensions,  improvements,  bug
       fixes, etc. The man page sources were  converted  to  YODL
       format  (another  excellent piece of Open Source software,
       available        at        ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter.
