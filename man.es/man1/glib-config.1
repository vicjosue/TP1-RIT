GLIB(1)                       1.2.10                      GLIB(1)



NAME
       glib-config   -   script  to  get  information  about  the
       installed version of GLib

SYNOPSIS
       glib-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--ver­
       sion] [--libs] [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       glib-config  is a tool that is used to configure to deter­
       mine the compiler and linker flags that should be used  to
       compile  and  link programs that use GLib. It is also used
       internally to the .m4 macros for  GNU  autoconf  that  are
       included with GLib.

OPTIONS
       glib-config accepts the following options:

       LIBRARIES
               GLib  has  three  libraries  'glib', 'gmodule' and
               'gthread'.  If you specify one of them,  only  the
               appropriate   things  for  that  library  will  be
               printed.

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of  GLib  on
               the standard output.

       --libs  Print  the linker flags that are necessary to link
               a GLib program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags  that  are  necessary  to
               compile a GLib program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installa­
               tion prefix that GLib was built with when  comput­
               ing   the  output  for  the  --cflags  and  --libs
               options. This option is also  used  for  the  exec
               prefix  if  --exec-prefix  was not specified. This
               option must be  specified  before  any  --libs  or
               --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installa­
               tion exec prefix that GLib  was  built  with  when
               computing  the  output for the --cflags and --libs
               options.  This option must be specified before any
               --libs or --cflags options.
