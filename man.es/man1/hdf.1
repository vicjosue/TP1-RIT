DESCRIPTION
       HDF is a multi-object file  format  that  facilitates  the
       transfer  of  various  types  of  scientific  data between
       machines and operating systems.  Machines  currently  sup­
       ported  include the Cray, HP, Vax, Sun, IBM RS/6000, Sili­
       con Graphics, Macintosh, and IBM PC computers.  HDF allows
       self-definitions  of  data  content and easy extensibility
       for future enhancements or compatibility with other  stan­
       dard  formats.  HDF  includes Fortran and C calling inter­
       faces,and utilities to prepare raw image of data files  or
       for  use  with  other NCSA software.  The HDF library con­
       tains interfaces for storing and retrieving compressed  or
       uncompressed 8-bit and 24-bit raster images with palettes,
       n-Dimensional scientific datasets and  binary  tables.  An
       interface  is  also included that allows arbitray grouping
       of other HDF objects.


   HDF Raster Images
       HDF supports the storing of both 8-bit and  24-bit  raster
       images.   As  well as storing information about the dimen­
       sions and palette of a raster image, HDF  supports  raster
       image  compression.   In  previous  versions  of HDF, Run-
       length encoding and  Imcomp  compression  were  both  sup­
       ported.  With HDF> 3.3 JPEG compression is also available.


   HDF Scientific Data Sets
       Scientific Data Sets (SDSs)  are  useful  for  storing  n-
       Dimensional  gridded data.  The actual data in the dataset
       can be of any of the "standard" number types:  8,  16  and
       32bit signed and unsigned integers and 32 and 64bit float­
       ing point values.  In addition, a certain amount of  meta-
       data can be stored with an SDS including:

         o The coordinate system to use when interpreting or displaying the data.
         o Scales to be used for each dimension.
         o Labels for each dimension and the dataset as a whole.
         o Units for each dimension and the data.
         o The valid max and min values for the data.
         o Calibration information for the data.
         o Fill or missing value information.
         o Ability of have more than one file open at a time.
         o A more general framework for meta-data within the SDS data-model
           (allowing 'name = value' styel meta-data).
         o Support for an "unlimited dimension" in the SDS data-model, making
           it possible to append planes to an array along one dimension.

   HDF Annotations
       Any  object in an HDF file can have annotations associated
       with it.  There are a number of types of annotations:

         o Labels are assumed to be short strings giving the "name" of a
           data object.
         o Descriptions are longer text segments that are useful for giving
           more indepth information about a data object
         o File annotations are assumed to apply to all of the objects in a
           single file.

   HDF Vset Interfaces
       The Vset module  provides  interfaces  to  two  basic  HDF
       building  blocks.   Vgroups  are generic grouping elements
       allowing a user to associate related objects within an HDF
       file.   As Vgroups can contain other Vgroups, it is possi­
       ble to build a hierarchical file.  Vdatas are data  struc­
       tures  made  up  of fields and records.  Data is organized
       into 'fields' within each Vdata.  Each field is identified
       by  a  unique  'fieldname'.  The type of each field may be
       any of the basic number types that HDF  supports.   Fields
       of different types may exist within the same Vdata.

       By combining Vdatas in Vgroups it is possible to represent
       higher level data  constructs:  mesh  data,  multi-variate
       datasets,  sparse  matrices,  finite-element data, spread­
       sheets, splines, non-Cartesian coordinate data, etc.


   HDF > 3.3 and netCDF
       HDF >  3.3  merges  in  the  netCDF  library  produced  by
       Unidata.  The full netCDF library is supported as is a new
       "multi-file" SDS interface.  Both of these interfaces  can
       read old netCDF files and HDF files transparently.



   EXAMPLES
       All HDF routines require the header "hdf.h" to be included
       in the C source file. If using the SDS routines the header
       "mfhdf.h"  should  be  included instead in in the C source
       file.  Fortran  programs  should  use   "dffunc.inc"   and
       "hdf.inc".

       To  compile  a  program  that makes HDF calls on most Unix
       platforms.

          HDFLIBDIR = /usr/local/lib/hdf
          HDFINC    = /usr/local/include/hdf

          (FORTRAN):
          f77 myprog.f -I{HDFINC} -o myprog {HDFLIBDIR}/libmfhdf.a \
          {HDFLIBDIR}/libdf.a  {HDFLIBDIR}/libjpeg.a {HDFLIBDIR}/libz.a

          (C):
          cc myprog.c -I{HDFINC} -o myprog {HDFLIBDIR}/libmfhdf.a \
          {HDFLIBDIR}/libdf.a  {HDFLIBDIR}/libjpeg.a {HDFLIBDIR}/libz.a
