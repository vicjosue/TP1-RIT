NAME
       ogginfo - gives information about Ogg files.


SYNOPSIS
       ogginfo file1.ogg ...  fileN.ogg


DESCRIPTION
       ogginfo  reads  one or more Ogg files and decodes the com­
       ments contained within, writing them to  standard  output,
       in  a  "attribute=value"  format, one per line.  The first
       attribute printed will  always  be  the  filename  of  the
       stream.  ogginfo cannot accept URLs.

       In  addition  to the comments, ogginfo will also print the
       following attributes for each logical bitstream within the
       file:

              serial The  serial number of the logical bitstream.

              header_integrity
                     "pass" if the header is intact,  and  "fail"
                     if it is corrupted.

              stream_integrity
                     "pass" if the stream contains no bad packets
                     or holes (not counting the last packet), and
                     "fail" otherwise.

              stream_truncated
                     "true" if the last good packet in the stream
                     is not marked as the last packet and "false"
                     if the stream is complete.

              vendor The  vendor  string  of  the encoder used to
                     make this stream.

              bitrate_upper
                     The upper bitrate limit of  the  stream,  or
                     "none" if not set.

              bitrate_nominal
                     The  "target"  bitrate  of  the  stream,  or
                     "none" if not set.

              bitrate_lower
                     The lower bitrate limit of  the  stream,  or
                     "none" if not set.

              bitrate_average
                     The average bitrate of the stream.

              length Length of of the file in seconds.

              playtime
                     Playing  time  in  a  humanly-readable MM:SS
                     format.

       At the end of each file, ogginfo will also print:

              total_playtime
                     The total playing time for the  entire  file
                     in seconds.


OPTIONS
       None.


BUGS
       Although  ogginfo  properly handles chained bitstreams, it
       cannot handle multiplexed logical bitstreams
