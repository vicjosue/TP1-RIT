NAME
       giftopnm - convert a GIF file into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       giftopnm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [-verbose] [-com­
       ments] [-image N] [GIFfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a GIF file for input, and outputs portable anymap.

       If you have an animated GIF file, you can extract individ­
       ual  frames  from  it with gifsicle and then convert those
       using giftopnm.

       A GIF image contains rectangular pixels.   They  all  have
       the  same  aspect ratio, but may not be square (it's actu­
       ally quite unusual for them not to be square, but it could
       happen).   The pixels of a Netpbm image are always square.
       Because of the computational complexity to  do  otherwise,
       giftopnm converts a GIF image to a Netpbm image pixel-for-
       pixel.  This means if the GIF pixels are not  square,  the
       Netpbm  output  image has the wrong aspect ratio.  In this
       case, giftopnm issues an informational message telling you
       to run pnmscale to correct the output.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              giftopnm creates a PGM (portable graymap) file con­
              taining the  alpha  channel  values  in  the  input
              image.  If the input image doesn't contain an alpha
              channel, the alpha-filename file contains all  zero
              (transparent)  alpha  values.  If you don't specify
              --alphaout, giftopnm does  not  generate  an  alpha
              file,  and if the input image has an alpha channel,
              giftopnm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename,  giftopnm  writes
              the  alpha  output  to Standard Output and discards
              the image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha  output
              file.

       -verbose
              Produce verbose output about the GIF file input.

       -comments
              Only output GIF89 comment fields.

       -image Output  the  specified gif image from the input GIF
              archive (where N is '1', '2',  '20'...).   Normally
              there is only one image per file, so this option is
              not needed.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique pre­
       fix.


BUGS
       This does not correctly handle the Plain Text Extension of
       the GIF89 standard, since I did not have any example input
       files containing them.

LICENSE
       If you use giftopnm, you are using a  patent  on  the  LZW
       compression  method  which  is owned by Unisys, and in all
       probability you do not have a license from  Unisys  to  do
       so.  Unisys typically asks $5000 for a license for trivial
       use of the patent.  Unisys has never enforced  the  patent
       against trivial users.  The patent expires in 2003.

       Rumor  has  it  that  IBM  also  owns  a  patent  covering
       giftopnm.

       A replacement for the GIF format that does not require any
       patents to use is the PNG format.
