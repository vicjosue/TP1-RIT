PS2PS(1)                Ghostscript Tools                PS2PS(1)



NAME
       eps2eps - Ghostscript Encapsulated PostScript "distiller"

SYNOPSIS
       eps2eps [ options ] input.eps output.eps

DESCRIPTION
       eps2eps  uses gs(1) to convert Encapsulated PostScript(tm)
       file "input.eps" to simpler and (usually) faster  Encapsu­
       lated  PostScript in "output.eps".  Normally the output is
       allowed to use PostScript  Level  2  constructs,  but  the
       -dLanguageLevel=1  option restricts the output to Level 1.

       Use eps2eps only for Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)  files;
       for ordinary PostScript (PS) files, use ps2ps.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documenta­
       tion on your system, from which you can get more  details.
