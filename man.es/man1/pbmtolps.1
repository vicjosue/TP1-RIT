NAME
       pbmtolps - convert portable bitmap to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolps [ -dpi n ] [ pbmfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable bitmap as input, and outputs PostScript.
       The output Postscript uses  lines  instead  of  the  image
       operator  to  generate  a (device dependent) picture which
       will be imaged much faster.

       The Postscript path length is constrained to be less  that
       1000  points  so  that  no limits are overrun on the Apple
       Laserwriter and (presumably) no other printers.
