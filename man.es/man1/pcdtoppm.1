DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes pcdtoppm from xpcd-2.04, a tool
       to  convert  Photo CD Images (*.pcd) into Portable Pixmaps
       (*.ppm) or JPEG (*.jp[e]g) images.

       Portable Pixmaps is  the  default  format  for  <outfile>.
       Using '-' as <outfile> writes to stdout.

       -h, --help
              Display a short usage help.

       -v, --verbose

       -1, --gray
              Produce a grayscaled image.

       -r<n>, --resolution=<n>
              Set Photo CD resolution to extract to <n>. Possible
              values for <n> are [1..5], with 1 being the lowest,
              5  the  highest  possible  resolution of a Photo CD
              image.  If this option is not given, 3 is  used  as
              default.

       -o<n>, --orientation=<n>
              Set orientation to <n>. Possible values for <n> are
              [0..3].  turned 270, '2' 180  and  '3'  90  degrees
              clockwise  from normal orientation.  If this option
              is not given, the default of the Photo CD image  is
              used.

       -g<WxH+L+T>, --geometry=<WxH+L+T>
              Crop  out  and  decode a given region of the image.
              All 4  values  are  mandatory:  W=width,  H=height,
              L/T=left/top offset

       -j[<quality>], --jpeg[=<quality>]
              Set  the  format  of  the  output file to JPEG; the
              optional argument <quality> may be used to set  the
              JPEG quality.
