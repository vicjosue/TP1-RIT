NAME
       install-menu  - Used internally by the Debian menu system.
       It is a program  to  facilitate  the  generate  the  menu-
       related startup files for the various window managers etc.


DESCRIPTION
       When update-menus(1) reads the menu-information, for  each
       installed window manager it will run /etc/menu-methods/wm.
       Update-menus sends  all menu-information of all  installed
       packages  to  the stdin of those programmes, and it is the
       task of each respective /etc/menu-methods/wm  to  generate
       the  window-manager  startup files that contain the Debian
       Menu structure.  install-menu  is  written  to  facilitate
       this  task.  For more information, see the menu documenta­
       tion (see below).


BUGS
       Once processing starts, and translation  in  various  lan­
       guages  is  requested, error messages will be printed in a
       `random' language. This is due to the fact that it doesn't
       seem possible to locally change the language with GNU get­
       text. Fortunately nearly all errors  are  reported  before
       processing starts, so usually the messages are reported in
       the current LANGUAGE.
