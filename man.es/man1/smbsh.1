NAME
       smbsh - Allows access to Windows NT filesystem  using UNIX
       commands

SYNOPSIS
       smbsh [ -W workgroup ]  [ -U username ]  [ -P prefix ]   [
       -R <name resolve order> ]  [ -d <debug level> ]  [ -l log­
       file ]  [ -L libdir ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       smbsh allows you to access an  NT  filesystem  using  UNIX
       commands such as ls,  egrep, and rcp. You must use a shell
       that is dynamically linked in order for smbsh to work cor­
       rectly.

OPTIONS
       -W WORKGROUP
              Override  the  default  workgroup  specified in the
              workgroup parameter of the smb.conf file  for  this
              session.  This  may  be  needed  to connect to some
              servers.

       -U username[%pass]
              Sets the SMB username or username and password.  If
              this  option  is  not  specified,  the user will be
              prompted for both the username and the password. If
              %pass  is  not specified, the user will be prompted
              for the password.

       -P prefix
              This option allows the user to  set  the  directory
              prefix  for  SMB  access. The default value if this
              option is not specified is smb.

       -R <name resolve order>
              This option is used to determine what  naming  ser­
              vices and in what order to resolve host names to IP
              addresses.  The  option  takes  a   space-separated
              string of different name resolution options.

              The  options  are  :"lmhosts",  "host",  "wins" and
              "bcast".  They cause names to be resolved  as  fol­
              lows :

              · lmhosts  :  Lookup  an  IP  address  in the Samba
                lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no  name
                type  attached  to  the  NetBIOS  name  (see  the
                lmhosts(5)  for  details)  then  any  name   type
                matches for lookup.

              · host : Do a standard host name to IP address res­
                olution, using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS
                lookups.  This method of name resolution is oper­
                ating system dependent, for instance on  IRIX  or
                Solaris  this  may be controlled by the /etc/nss­
                witch.conf file). Note that this method  is  only
                used  if  the  NetBIOS name type being queried is
                the 0x20 (server)  name  type,  otherwise  it  is
                ignored.

              · wins : Query a name with the IP address listed in
                the wins server parameter. If no WINS server  has
                been specified this method will be ignored.

              · bcast : Do a broadcast on each of the known local
                interfaces listed in  the  interfaces  parameter.
                This is the least reliable of the name resolution
                methods as it depends on the target host being on
                a locally connected subnet.

       If  this  parameter is not set then the name resolve order
       defined in  the  smb.conf  file  parameter  (name  resolve
       order) will be used.


       The  default  order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without
       this parameter or any entry  in  the  name  resolve  order
       parameter  of the smb.conf file, the name resolution meth­
       ods will be attempted in this order.


       -d <debug level>
              debug level is an integer from 0 to 10.

              The default value if this parameter is  not  speci­
              fied is zero.

              The  higher  this  value,  the  more detail will be
              logged about the activities of nmblookup. At  level
              0,  only  critical errors and serious warnings will
              be logged.

       -l logfilename
              If specified causes all debug messages to be  writ­
              ten  to  the file specified by logfilename . If not
              specified then all messages will be  written  tost­
              derr.

       -L libdir
              This parameter specifies the location of the shared
              libraries used by smbsh. The default value is spec­
              ified at compile time.

EXAMPLES
       To  use  the smbsh command, execute  smbsh from the prompt
       and enter the username and password that authenticates you
       to the machine running the Windows NT operating system.


            system% smbsh
            Username: user
            Password: XXXXXXX



       Any dynamically linked command you execute from this shell
       will access the /smb directory using the smb protocol. For
       example,  the  command  ls  /smb will show a list of work­
       groups. The command ls /smb/MYGROUP   will  show  all  the
       machines   in   the  workgroup  MYGROUP.  The  command  ls
       /smb/MYGROUP/<machine-name> will show the share names  for
       that  machine.  You  could  then, for example, use the  cd
       command to change directories, vi to edit files,  and  rcp
       to copy files.

VERSION
       This  man  page  is  correct  for version 2.2 of the Samba
       suite.

BUGS
       smbsh works by intercepting the standard libc  calls  with
       the  dynamically loaded versions in  smbwrapper.o. Not all
       calls have been "wrapped", so some programs may not  func­
       tion correctly under smbsh .

       Programs  which are not dynamically linked cannot make use
       of smbsh's functionality. Most versions  of  UNIX  have  a
       file  command that will describe how a program was linked.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
