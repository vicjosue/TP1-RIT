UPDATE-MENUS(1L)                                 UPDATE-MENUS(1L)



NAME
       update-menus - generate Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS
       update-menus [-v] [-d] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Before  the advent of update-menus, when the system admin­
       istrator installed a package onto a  Debian  system,  they
       would  need  to  edit various window manager configuration
       files to make the new program show  up  on,  for  example,
       fvwm's  menus.  The  menus could easily become out of sync
       with what programs were actually available, with some menu
       items  that  didn't work, and other programs that lacked a
       menu entry.  update-menus and Debian's menu package aim to
       solve this problem.

       update-menus  automatically  generates  menus of installed
       programs for window managers and other menu  programs.  It
       should  be  run whenever a menufile(5) or menu-method file
       is changed.  update-menus will be ran  automatically  when
       Debian  packages  that contain menu files are installed or
       removed from the system.

       update-menus uses the package-supplied  menu  entry  files
       (in  /usr/lib/menu)  for  it's information about the menus
       (but this can  be  overruled  by  the  system  administra­
       tor/user,  see below). If a menu entry file is executable,
       update-menus execute the menu entry  file,  and  use  it's
       stdout to generate the menu database.


OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose   output.   Shows   all  arguments  to  the
              /etc/menu-methods programs.

       -d     Debug output.  Generates  loads  of  unintelligible
              output.

       -h     Display usage help and exit.

CONFIGURATION
       There  are  several  ways to tune the operation of update-
       menus:

       per menu entry, in /etc/menu/$package
              In these directory the system administrator or user
              can  override  the  default  menu files. (if a file
              /etc/menu/$package exists, than  the  corresponding
              /usr/lib/menu/$package  file  isn't read any more).
              Users who want to override the system wide defaults
              put their files in ~/.menu. See also menufile(5)
       per window-manager in /etc/menu-methods/$wm
              In  these  configuration files, one can tune gener­
              ated "system.rc" files for each  individual  window
              manager.  For  example, one can specify that the wm
              should ignore any icons that the packages may  sup­
              ply,  or  set  the  default  wrapper  for text-only
              applications (usually, an xterm is started to run a
              text-only  application  like vi). Users who want to
              override the system wide defaults put  their  files
              in    ~/.menu-methods.    For    more   info,   see
              /usr/doc/menu/html.
       globally, in /etc/menu-methods/translate_menus
              This file contains translations that will  be  per­
              formed  for  all  menu  entries and all window man­
              agers. You can specify things like:  `All  sections
              that  start  with  "Apps/Games" should be mapped to
              "Games"', or `menuentryid "gnuplot" should  have  a
              title of "GnuTeken" (to translate titles into other
              other languages)'. Look at the  default  /etc/menu-
              methods/translate_menus  for  an example. Users who
              want to override the system default translate file,
              put one in ~/.menu-methods/translate_menus.
       error report configuring, in /etc/menu-methods/menu.config
              This file  contains  general  information  for  the
              overall  behaviour  of  update-menus. At the moment
              you can only configure how verbose  the  output  of
              update-menus is, and where it sends the output. The
              amount  of  information  is  specified   by   `ver­
              bosity=VAL'. Use VAL=quite to stop update-menu from
              reporting anything but the most  important  errors,
              VAL=normal,  VAL=verbose,  VAL=debug  for  progres­
              sively more output.

              To  specify  where  the  output  should   go,   use
              `method=stdout', `method=stderr', or `method=syslog
              facility priority'.  `Facility'  is  one  of  auth,
              authpriv,  authcron,  authdaemon, authkern, authlo­
              cal0, authlocal1, authlocal2,  authlocal3,  authlo­
              cal4,  authlocal5, authlocal6, authlocal7, authlpr,
              authmail, authnews, authsyslog, authuser, authuucp.
              `priority' is one of emerg, alert, crit, err, warn­
              ing, notice, info, debug.


FILES
       Menu files: (Earlier  listed  directories  override  those
       listed later.)
              ~/.menu/*
                     Menu files added by the user. (Isn't read if
                     root runs update-menus)
              /etc/menu/*
                     Menu files added by the  system  administra­
                     tor.
              /usr/lib/menu/*
                     Menu  files  provided  by other Debian pack­
                     ages.
              /usr/lib/menu/default/*
                     Menu files provided  by  the  menu  package.
                     (These  are  for packages that don't provide
                     menu entries yet. If you see (or maintain) a
                     package   that   supplies  a  menu  file  in
                     /usr/lib/menu/, please  email  me  and  I'll
                     remove      that      menu     file     from
                     /usr/lib/menu/default/).
       Menu methods:
              /etc/menu-methods/
                     Executable  configuration  files  that   are
                     added by window managers and other menu pro­
                     grams, these files are run  by  update-menus
                     to  generate  menus  for  the different pro­
                     grams. Also in this directory is the  trans­
                     late  file,  used for local configuration of
                     the shape of the menu trees.
              ~/.menu-methods/
                     For users to override the system-defaults of
                     /etc/menu-methods.     If   this   directory
                     exists, no files  in  /etc/menu-methods  are
                     read any more.

BUGS
       update-menus  may  not  work properly when run by a normal
       user, to generate menus for that  user.  This  is  usually
       because   the  window  manager  doesn't  expect  the  sys­
       tem."$wm"rc files in the directory (usually ~/."$wm", con­
       figurable  in /etc/menu-methods). If you see such a thing,
       and   you   find    a    solution,    please    mail    me
       (joostje@debian.org).  It  should  work  OK  for  fvwm and
       fvwm2: I usually test the package  first  as  an  ordinary
       user.

THANKS
       To Joey Hess, for a lot  of  good  ideas  and  pre-release
       testing,  and to Tom Lees for a update-menus in pure C (of
       which I only used one function, but that's life).
