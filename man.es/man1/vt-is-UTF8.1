VT-IS-UTF8(1)          Linux User's Manual          VT-IS-UTF8(1)



NAME
       vt-is-UTF8 - check whether current VT is in UTF8- or byte-
       mode.


SYNOPSIS
       vt-is-UTF8 [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-q|--quiet]


DESCRIPTION
       vt-is-UTF8 checks whether the current VT is in UTF8  mode,
       by  writing  (and  erasing  afterwards) a 3-byte-long UTF8
       sequence, and looking how much chars  where  displayed  by
       the console driver.

       A  message  telling  in  which mode the console is is then
       written to  stdout  (except  if  the  --quiet  option  was
       given).

       If  the --quiet option is not given, the value returned is
       1 if an error occurs, else 0.


OPTIONS
       -h --help
              display version number, a short  help  message  and
              exit.


       -V --version
              display version number and exit.


       -q --quiet
              do  not  print  on  stdout in with mode we are, but
              return the state as exit-status 1 if in  UTF8-mode,
              0  if in byte-mode. In case of error, 0 is returned
              and a message is displayed on stderr.


BUGS
       The check should be done by directly  asking  the  kernel,
       which is not possible as of kernels 2.0.x.

       As  of  kernel  2.0.35,  the  byte-mode is sometimes erro­
       neously detected as  UTF8-mode,  after  switching  from  a
       512-chars  font  to  a 256-chars font.  This is probably a
       console-driver bug.
