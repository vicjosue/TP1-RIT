DESCRIPTION
       oggenc reads audio data in either raw, WAV, or AIFF format
       and  encodes  it  into an Ogg Vorbis stream.  If the input
       file "-" is specified, audio data is read from  stdin  and
       the  Vorbis  stream  is  written  to  stdout unless the -o
       option is used to redirect the output.  By  default,  disk
       files  are  output  to  Ogg Vorbis files of the same name,
       with the extension changed to ".ogg".  This naming conven­
       tion  can  be  overridden by the -o option (in the case of
       one file) or the -n option (in the case of several files).


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show command help.

       -r, --raw
              Assume  input  data is raw little-endian audio data
              with no header information. If  other  options  are
              not  specified,  defaults to 44.1kHz stereo 16 bit.
              See next three options for how to change this.

       -B n, --raw-bits=n
              Sets raw input sample size in bits. Default is  16.

       -C n, --raw-chan=n
              Sets raw input number of channels. Default is 2.

       -R n, --raw-rate=n
              Sets raw input samplerate. Default is 44100.

       -Q, --quiet
              Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.

       -b n, --bitrate=n
              Sets  encoding  to  the  bitrate  closest  to n (in
              kb/s).

       -m n, --min-bitrate=n
              Sets minimum bitrate to n (in kb/s).

       -M n, --max-bitrate=n
              Sets maximum bitrate to n (in kb/s).

       -q n, --quality=n
              Sets encoding quality to n, between 0 (low) and  10
              (high). This is the default mode of operation.

       -s, --serial
              Forces  a  specific  serial  number  in  the output
              stream. This is primarily useful for testing.

       -o output_file, --output=output_file
              Write the Ogg Vorbis stream  to  output_file  (only
              valid if a single input file is specified)


       -n pattern, --names=pattern
              Produce  filenames as this string, with %a, %t, %l,
              %G replaced by artist,  title,  album  respectively
              (see  below for specifying these). Also, %% gives a
              literal %.


       -c comment, --comment comment
              Add the string comment as an extra  comment.   This
              may  be used multiple times, and all instances will
              be added to each of the input files specified.


       -a artist, --artist artist
              Set the artist comment field  in  the  comments  to
              artist.


       -G genre, --genre genre
              Set  the  genre  comment  field  in the comments to
              genre.


       -d date, --date date
              Sets the date comment field  to  the  given  value.
              This should be the date of recording.


       -N n, --tracknum n
              Sets  the  track  number comment field to the given
              value.


       -t title, --title title
              Set the track title comment field to title.


       -l album, --album album
              Set the album comment field to album.


       Note that the -a, -t, and -l options can be given multiple
       times.   They  will  be  applied, one to each file, in the
       order given.  If there are fewer album, title,  or  artist
       comments  given  than  there  are input files, oggenc will
       reuse the final one for the remaining files, and  issue  a
       warning in the case of repeated titles.


EXAMPLES
       Simplest version. Produces output as somefile.ogg:
              oggenc somefile.wav


       Specifying an output filename:
              oggenc somefile.wav -o out.ogg


       Specifying a high-quality encoding averaging 256 kbps.
              oggenc infile.wav -b 256 out.ogg


       Specifying a maximum and average bitrate.
              oggenc infile.wav -b 128 -M 160 out.ogg


       Specifying  quality  rather  than  bitrate (to a very high
       quality mode)
              oggenc infile.wav -q 9 out.ogg


       Adding some info about the track:
              oggenc somefile.wav -t "The track title" -a "artist
              who  performed  this" -l "name of album" -c "OTHER­
              FIELD=contents of some other  field  not  explictly
              supported"


       This   encodes   the  three  files,  each  with  the  same
       artist/album tag, but with different title  tags  on  each
       one. The string given as an argument to -n is used to gen­
       erate filenames, as shown in the section above. This exam­
       ple gives filenames like "The Tea Party - Touch.ogg":
              oggenc  -b  192 -a "The Tea Party" -l "Triptych" -t
              "Touch" track01.wav -t "Underground" track02.wav -t
              "Great Big Lie" track03.wav -n "%a - %t.ogg"


       Encoding from stdin, to stdout (you can also use the vari­
       ous tagging options, like -t, -a, -l, etc.):
              oggenc -

BUGS
       Options -m, -M, and -q for  for  flexible  bitrate/quality
       selection  exist,  but  are  not implemented in the vorbis
       encoder, and so are not documented here yet.
