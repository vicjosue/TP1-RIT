       OpenBSD,  Solaris, IRIX, HPUX, Digital Unix,

BUGS
       Can't  connect  to some FTP servers (Novell,
       NT).  Connection  stays  in  "Request  sent"
       state.

       Frames  don't  work  if there're more frames
       with same name. Turn them off in such  case.

       You  can't  upload  large  files;  it  takes
       _lots_ of memory.

       You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are  in  a
       viewer
