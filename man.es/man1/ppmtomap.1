ppmtomap(1)                                           ppmtomap(1)



NAME
       ppmtomap - extract all colors from a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtomap [-sort] [-square] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap  as input.  Produces a portable
       pixmap as output, representing a color map  of  the  input
       file.  All  N  different  colors  found  are put in an Nx1
       portable pixmap.  This color map file can  be  used  as  a
       mapfile for ppmquant or ppmtogif.

OPTIONS
       -sort  Produces  a portable pixmap with the colors in some
              sorted order.

       -square
              Produces a  (more  or  less)  square  output  file,
              instead of putting all colors on the top row.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique pre­
       fix.

WARNING
       If you want to use the output file as a mapfile  for  ppm­
       togif, you first have to do a ppmquant 256, since ppmtomap
       is not limited to 256 colors (but to 65536).
