NAME
       onsgmls - An SGML System Conforming to International Stan­
       dard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       onsgmls [-BCdeglprsuv] [-alinktype] [-bbctf] [-csysid...]
               [-Ddirectory] [-Emax_errors] [-ffile]
               [-iname] [-ooutput_option...] [-tfile]
               [-wwarning_type...] [sysid...]


DESCRIPTION
       onsgmls parses and validates the SGML document whose docu­
       ment   entity  is  specified  by  the  system  identifiers
       [sysid...] and prints on the standard output a simple text
       representation  of  its Element Structure Information Set.
       (This is the information set which a  structure-controlled
       conforming SGML application should act upon.) If more than
       one system identifier is specified, then the corresponding
       entities will be concatenated to form the document entity.
       Thus the document  entity  may  be  spread  among  several
       files; for example, the SGML declaration, prolog and docu­
       ment instance set could each be in a separate file. If  no
       system  identifiers  are specified, then onsgmls will read
       the document entity from the  standard  input.  A  command
       line  system  identifier  of - can be used to refer to the
       standard input. (Normally in a system identifier,  <OSFD>0
       is used to refer to standard input.)


       The following options are available:


       -alinktype
              Make link type linktype active. Not all ESIS infor­
              mation is output in this case: the active LPDs  are
              not   explicitly   reported,   although  each  link
              attribute is qualified with  its  link  type  name;
              there is no information about result elements; when
              there are multiple link  rules  applicable  to  the
              current  element, onsgmls always chooses the first.


       -bbctf, -bencoding
              This determines the encoding used for output. If in
              fixed  character  set mode it specifies the name of
              an encoding; if not, it specifies  the  name  of  a
              BCTF.


       -B     Batch  mode.  Parse  each sysid... specified on the
              command line separately, rather than  concatenating
              them. This is useful mainly with -s.

              If -tfilename is also specified, then the specified
              filename will be prefixed to the sysid to make  the
              filename for the RAST result for each sysid.


       -csysid
              Map  public  identifiers and entity names to system
              identifiers using  the  catalog  entry  file  whose
              system identifier is sysid. Multiple -c options are
              allowed. If there is a catalog  entry  file  called
              catalog  in  the same place as the document entity,
              it will be searched  for  immediately  after  those
              specified by -c.


       -C     The  [filename...]  arguments specify catalog files
              rather  than  the  document  entity.  The  document
              entity  is specified by the first DOCUMENT entry in
              the catalog files.


       -Ddirectory
              Search directory  for  files  specified  in  system
              identifiers.  Multiple  -D options are allowed. See
              the description of the osfile storage  manager  for
              more information about file searching.


       -e     Describe  open  entities  in  error messages. Error
              messages always include the position  of  the  most
              recently opened external entity.


       -Emax_errors
              onsgmls  will  exit  after  max_errors  errors.  If
              max_errors is 0, there is no limit on the number of
              errors. The default is 200.


       -ffile Redirect errors to file. This is useful mainly with
              shells that do not support redirection of stderr.


       -g     Show the generic identifiers of  open  elements  in
              error messages.


       -iname Pretend that

              <!ENTITY % name "INCLUDE">

              occurs  at  the start of the document type declara­
              tion subset in  the  SGML  document  entity.  Since
              repeated definitions of an entity are ignored, this
              definition will take precedence over any other def­
              initions of this entity in the document type decla­
              ration. Multiple -i options  are  allowed.  If  the
              SGML declaration replaces the reserved name INCLUDE
              then the new reserved name will be the  replacement
              text  of  the  entity.  Typically the document type
              declaration will contain

              <!ENTITY % name "IGNORE">

              and will use %name; in the status keyword  specifi­
              cation  of  a  marked  section declaration. In this
              case the effect of the option will be to cause  the
              marked section not to be ignored.


       -ooutput_option
              Output  additional  information  according  to out­
              put_option:

              entity Output definitions of all  general  entities
              not  just for data or subdoc entities that are ref­
              erenced  or  named  in  an   ENTITY   or   ENTITIES
              attribute.

              id  Distinguish  attributes whose declared value is
              ID.

              line Output L commands giving the current line num­
              ber and filename.

              included  Output an i command for included sub-ele­
              ments.

              empty Output an e command for  elements  which  are
              not  allowed to have an end-tag, that is those with
              a declared content of empty or with a content  ref­
              erence attribute.

              notation-sysid Output an f command before an N com­
              mand, if a system identifier could be generated for
              that notation.

              nonsgml In fixed character set mode, output  escape
              sequences for non-SGML  data  characters.  Non-SGML
              data  characters  can result from numeric character
              references.

              Multiple -o options are allowed.


       -p     Parse only the  prolog.  onsgmls  will  exit  after
              parsing  the document type declaration. Implies -s.


       -s     Suppress  output.  Error  messages  will  still  be
              printed.


       -tfile Output  to  file  the  RAST  result  as  defined by
              ISO/IEC 13673:1995 (actually this isn't quite an IS
              yet;  this  implements  the  Intermediate  Editor's
              Draft of  1994/08/29,  with  changes  to  implement
              ISO/IEC  JTC1/SC18/WG8 N1777). The normal output is
              not produced.


       -v     Print the version number.


       -wtype Control warnings and errors.  Multiple  -w  options
              are  allowed.  The  following values of type enable
              warnings:

              xml Warn about constructs that are not  allowed  by
              XML.

              mixed  Warn  about mixed content models that do not
              allow #pcdata anywhere.

              sgmldecl Warn about various  dubious  constructions
              in the SGML declaration.

              should  Warn  about various recommendations made in
              ISO 8879 that the document does  not  comply  with.
              (Recommendations  are expressed with ``should'', as
              distinct  from  requirements  which   are   usually
              expressed with ``shall''.)

              default Warn about defaulted references.

              duplicate Warn about duplicate entity declarations.

              undefined Warn about undefined  elements:  elements
              used in the DTD but not defined.

              unclosed Warn about unclosed start and end-tags.

              empty Warn about empty start and end-tags.

              net  Warn  about  net-enabling  start-tags and null
              end-tags.

              min-tag Warn about minimized  start  and  end-tags.
              Equivalent  to  combination  of unclosed, empty and
              net warnings.

              unused-map Warn about unused short reference  maps:
              maps  that are declared with a short reference map­
              ping declaration but never used in a  short  refer­
              ence use declaration in the DTD.

              unused-param Warn about parameter entities that are
              defined but not used  in  a  DTD.  Unused  internal
              parameter  entities whose text is INCLUDE or IGNORE
              won't get the warning.

              notation-sysid Warn about notations  for  which  no
              system identifier could be generated.

              all  Warn  about  conditions that should usually be
              avoided (in the opinion of the author).  Equivalent
              to:  mixed,  should,  default, undefined, sgmldecl,
              unused-map, unused-param, empty and unclosed.

              A warning can be disabled by using  its  name  pre­
              fixed  with  no-.  Thus  -wall  -wno-duplicate will
              enable all warnings except  those  about  duplicate
              entity declarations.

              The   following  values  for  warning_type  disable
              errors:

              no-idref Do not give an error for an  ID  reference
              value  which  no  element has as its ID. The effect
              will be as if each attribute declared as an ID ref­
              erence value had been declared as a name.

              no-significant  Do not give an error when a charac­
              ter that is not a significant character in the ref­
              erence  concrete  syntax occurs in a literal in the
              SGML declaration. This may be useful in conjunction
              with certain buggy test suites.

              no-valid  Do  not  require the document to be type-
              valid. This has the effect  of  changing  the  SGML
              declaration to specify VALIDITY NOASSERT and IMPLY­
              DEF ATTLIST YES ELEMENT YES. An option  of  -wvalid
              has  the effect of changing the SGML declaration to
              specify VALIDITY TYPE and IMPLYDEF ATTLIST NO  ELE­
              MENT  NO.  If  neither  -wvalid  nor -wno-valid are
              specified, then the VALIDITY and IMPLYDEF specified
              in the SGML declaration will be used.


       The following options are also supported for backward com­
       patibility with sgmls:


       -d     Same as -wduplicate.


       -l     Same as -oline.


       -msysid
              Same as -c.


       -r     Same as -wdefault.


       -u     Same as -wundef.
