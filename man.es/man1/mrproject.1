NAME
       MrProject - A Project Management Application for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       mrproject [--debug= LEVEL]

DESCRIPTION
       MrProject  is  a  project management program that can help
       build project plans, and track the progress of a  project.
       MrProject  is  built  on a client/server architecture, and
       uses CORBA and Bonobo for the communications  between  the
       client  and  the  server.  The server is called mrproject-
       engine(1) and should never be started  manually.   Instead
       run-mrproject(1) should be used.

              These  files  are  created  whenever mrproject seg­

              was active.
