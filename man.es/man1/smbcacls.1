NAME
       smbcacls  -  Set  or  get  ACLs on an NT file or directory
       names

SYNOPSIS
       smbcacls //server/share filename [ -U  username  ]   [  -A
       acls ]  [ -M acls ]  [ -D acls ]  [ -S acls ]  [ -C name ]
       [ -G name ]  [ -n ]  [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       The smbcacls program manipulates NT Access  Control  Lists
       (ACLs) on SMB file shares.

OPTIONS
       The  following  options are available to the smbcacls pro­
       gram.  The format of ACLs is described in the section  ACL
       FORMAT

       -A acls
              Add  the  ACLs  specified to the ACL list. Existing
              access control entries are unchanged.

       -M acls
              Modify the mask value (permissions)  for  the  ACLs
              specified  on  the  command  line. An error will be
              printed for each ACL specified that was not already
              present in the ACL list

       -D acls
              Delete  any ACLs specified on the command line.  An
              error will be printed for each ACL  specified  that
              was not already present in the ACL list.

       -S acls
              This  command  sets  the ACLs on the file with only
              the ones specified on the command line.  All  other
              ACLs  are  erased. Note that the ACL specified must
              contain at least a revision, type, owner and  group
              for the call to succeed.

       -U username
              Specifies  a username used to connect to the speci­
              fied service. The  username  may  be  of  the  form
              "username"  in  which  case the user is prompted to
              enter in a password and the workgroup specified  in
              the  smb.conf  file is used, or "username%password"
              or "DOMAIN\username%password" and the password  and
              workgroup names are used as provided.

       -C name
              The  owner of a file or directory can be changed to
              the name given using the -C option.  The  name  can
              be  a  sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved
              against the server specified in the first argument.

              This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name.

       -G name
              The  group  owner  of  a  file  or directory can be
              changed to the name given using the -G option.  The
              name  can  be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name
              resolved against the server specified n  the  first
              argument.

              This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.

       -n     This option displays all ACL information in numeric
              format. The default is to convert SIDs to names and
              ACE types and masks to a readable string format.

       -h     Print usage information on the smbcacls program.

ACL FORMAT
       The  format of an ACL is one or more ACL entries separated
       by either commas or newlines. An ACL entry is one  of  the
       following:



       REVISION:<revision number>
       OWNER:<sid or name>
       GROUP:<sid or name>
       ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>



       The  revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT
       ACL revision for the security descriptor.  If  not  speci­
       fied it defaults to 1. Using values other than 1 may cause
       strange behaviour.

       The owner and group specify the owner and group  sids  for
       the  object.  If a SID in the format CWS-1-x-y-z is speci­
       fied  this  is  used,  otherwise  the  name  specified  is
       resolved  using  the server on which the file or directory
       resides.

       ACLs specify permissions granted  to  the  SID.  This  SID
       again  can be specified in CWS-1-x-y-z format or as a name
       in which case it is resolved against the server  on  which
       the  file  or  directory resides. The type, flags and mask
       values determine the type of access granted to the SID.

       The type can be either 0 or 1 corresponding to ALLOWED  or
       DENIED  access  to the SID. The flags values are generally
       zero for file ACLs and either 9 or 2 for  directory  ACLs.
       Some common flags are:

       · #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT 0x1

       · #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT 0x2

       · #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT 0x4

       · #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY 0x8

       At  present flags can only be specified as decimal or hex­
       adecimal values.


       The mask is a  value  which  expresses  the  access  right
       granted  to  the SID. It can be given as a decimal or hex­
       adecimal value, or by using  one  of  the  following  text
       strings  which  map to the NT file permissions of the same
       name.


       · R - Allow read access

       · W - Allow write access

       · X - Execute permission on the object

       · D - Delete the object

       · P - Change permissions

       · O - Take ownership

       The following combined permissions can be specified:


       · READ - Equivalent to 'RX' permissions

       · CHANGE - Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions

       · FULL - Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' permissions

EXIT STATUS
       The smbcacls program sets the exit status depending on the
       success  or  otherwise  of  the operations performed.  The
       exit status may be one of the following values.

       If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit sta­
       tus  of  0.  If smbcacls couldn't connect to the specified
       server, or there was an error getting or setting the ACLs,
       an  exit  status  of  1 is returned. If there was an error
       parsing any command line arguments, an exit status of 2 is
       returned.

VERSION
       This  man  page  is  correct  for version 2.2 of the Samba
       suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       smbcacls was written by Andrew Tridgell and Tim Potter.

       The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald
       Carter
