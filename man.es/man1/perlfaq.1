       You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
       perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com .  This alias should not be
       used to ask FAQs.  It's for fixing the current FAQ.  Send
       questions to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.

       Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're
       suggestions of new questions to add to the FAQ, in which
       case they should have gone to the perlfaq-sugges­
       tions@perl.com instead.

       You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you
       would have learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appro­
       priate place to go for free advice.  If your question is
       really important and you require a prompt and correct
       answer, you should hire a consultant.

       When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never
       realized it would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor
       that Perl would ever become so popular and widespread.
       This document could not have been written without the
       tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the rest of the
       Perl Porters.
