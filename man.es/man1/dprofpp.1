       The dprofpp command interprets profile data produced by a
       profiler, such as the Devel::DProf profiler.  Dprofpp will
       read the file tmon.out and will display the 15 subroutines
       which are using the most time.  By default the times for
       each subroutine are given exclusive of the times of their
       child subroutines.

       To profile a Perl script run the perl interpreter with the
       --dd switch.  So to profile script test.pl with Devel::DProf
       the following command should be used.

               $ perl5 -d:DProf test.pl

       Then run dprofpp to analyze the profile.  The output of
       dprofpp depends on the flags to the program and the ver­
       sion of Perl you're using.

               $ dprofpp -u
               Total Elapsed Time =    1.67 Seconds
                        User Time =    0.61 Seconds
               Exclusive Times
               %Time Seconds     #Calls sec/call Name
                52.4   0.320          2   0.1600 main::foo
                45.9   0.280        200   0.0014 main::bar
                0.00   0.000          1   0.0000 DynaLoader::import
                0.00   0.000          1   0.0000 main::baz

       The dprofpp tool can also run the profiler before analyz­
       ing the profile data.  The above two commands can be exe­
       cuted with one dprofpp command.

               $ dprofpp -u -p test.pl

       Consult the PROFILE FORMAT entry in the Devel::DProf man­
       page for a description of the raw profile.

OOUUTTPPUUTT
       Columns are:

       %Time
           Percentage of time spent in this routine.

       #Calls
           Number of calls to this routine.



       sec/call
           Average number of seconds per call to this routine.

       Name
           Name of routine.

       CumulS
           Time (in seconds) spent in this routine and routines
           called from it.

       ExclSec
           Time (in seconds) spent in this routine (not including
           those called from it).

       Csec/c
           Average time (in seconds) spent in each call of this
           routine (including those called from it).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa   Sort alphabetically by subroutine names.

       --AA   Count timing for autoloaded subroutine as timing for
            "*::AUTOLOAD".  Otherwise the time to autoload it is
            counted as time of the subroutine itself (there is no
            way to separate autoload time from run time).

            This is going to be irrelevant with newer Perls.
            They will inform "Devel::DProf" when the "AUTOLOAD"
            switches to actual subroutine, so a separate statis­
            tics for "AUTOLOAD" will be collected no matter
            whether this option is set.

       --RR   Count anonymous subroutines defined in the same pack­
            age separately.

       --EE   (default)  Display all subroutine times exclusive of
            child subroutine times.

       --FF   Force the generation of fake exit timestamps if
            dprofpp reports that the profile is garbled.  This is
            only useful if dprofpp determines that the profile is
            garbled due to missing exit timestamps.  You're on
            your own if you do this.  Consult the BUGS section.

       --II   Display all subroutine times inclusive of child sub­
            routine times.

       --ll   Sort by number of calls to the subroutines.  This may
            help identify candidates for inlining.

       --OO ccnntt
            Show only cnt subroutines.  The default is 15.

       --pp ssccrriipptt
            Tells dprofpp that it should profile the given script
            and then interpret its profile data.  See --QQ.

       --QQ   Used with --pp to tell dprofpp to quit after profiling
            the script, without interpreting the data.

       --qq   Do not display column headers.

       --rr   Display elapsed real times rather than user+system
            times.


       --ss   Display system times rather than user+system times.

       --TT   Display subroutine call tree to stdout.  Subroutine
            statistics are not displayed.

       --tt   Display subroutine call tree to stdout.  Subroutine
            statistics are not displayed.  When a function is
            called multiple consecutive times at the same calling
            level then it is displayed once with a repeat count.

       --SS   Display merged subroutine call tree to stdout.
            Statistics is displayed for each branch of the tree.

            When a function is called multiple (not necessarily
            consecutive) times in the same branch then all these
            calls go into one branch of the next level.  A repeat
            count is output together with combined inclusive,
            exclusive and kids time.

            Branches are sorted w.r.t. inclusive time.

       --UU   Do not sort.  Display in the order found in the raw
            profile.

       --uu   Display user times rather than user+system times.

       --VV   Print dprofpp's version number and exit.  If a raw
            profile is found then its XS_VERSION variable will be
            displayed, too.

       --vv   Sort by average time spent in subroutines during each
            call.  This may help identify candidates for inlin­
            ing.

       --zz   (default) Sort by amount of user+system time used.
            The first few lines should show you which subroutines
            are using the most time.

       --gg ""subroutine""
            Ignore subroutines except "subroutine" and whatever
            is called from it.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The environment variable DDPPRROOFFPPPP_OOPPTTSS can be set to a
       string containing options for dprofpp.  You might use this
       if you prefer --II over --EE or if you want --FF on all the
       time.

       This was added fairly lazily, so there are some undesir­
       able side effects.  Options on the commandline should
       override options in DPROFPP_OPTS--but don't count on that
       in this version.

BBUUGGSS
       Applications which call _exit() or exec() from within a
       subroutine will leave an incomplete profile.  See the --FF
       option.

       Any bugs in Devel::DProf, or any profiler generating the
       profile data, could be visible here.  See the BUGS entry
       in the Devel::DProf manpage.

       Mail bug reports and feature requests to the perl5-porters
       mailing list at <perl5-porters@perl.org>.  Bug reports
       should include the output of the --VV option.
