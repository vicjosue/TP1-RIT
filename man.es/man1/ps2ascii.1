PS2ASCII(1)             Ghostscript Tools             PS2ASCII(1)



NAME
       ps2ascii  -  Ghostscript translator from PostScript or PDF
       to ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ascii [ input.ps [ output.txt ] ]
       ps2ascii input.pdf [ output.txt ]

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ascii  uses  gs(1)   to   extract   ASCII   text   from
       PostScript(tm)  or  Adobe  Portable  Document Format (PDF)
       files. If no files are specified on the command  line,  gs
       reads from standard input; but PDF input must come from an
       explicitly-named file, not standard input.  If  no  output
       file  is  specified, the ASCII text is written to standard
       output.

       ps2ascii doesn't look at font  encoding,  and  isn't  very
       good  at  dealing with kerning, so for PostScript (but not
       currently PDF), you might consider pstotext (see below).

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documenta­
       tion  on your system, from which you can get more details.
