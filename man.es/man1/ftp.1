NAME
       ftp - ARPANET file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
       ftp  [-v]  [-d]  [-i]  [-n] [-g] [-k realm] [-f] [-x] [-u]
       [-t] [host]

DESCRIPTION
       FTP is the user interface to  the  ARPANET  standard  File
       Transfer  Protocol.  The program allows a user to transfer
       files to and from a remote network site.

OPTIONS
       Options may be specified at the command line,  or  to  the
       command interpreter.

       -v     Verbose  option  forces  ftp  to show all responses
              from the remote server, as well as report  on  data
              transfer statistics.

       -n     Restrains  ftp  from attempting ``auto-login'' upon
              initial connection.  If auto-login is enabled,  ftp
              will  check  the  .netrc  (see  below)  file in the
              user's home directory for an  entry  describing  an
              account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists,
              ftp will prompt for the remote machine  login  name
              (default   is   the  user  identity  on  the  local
              machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a  password
              and an account with which to login.

       -u     Restrains  ftp  from  attempting ``auto-authentica­
              tion'' upon initial connection.  If  auto-authenti­
              cation  is enabled, ftp attempts to authenticate to
              the FTP server by sending the AUTH  command,  using
              whichever  authentication  types  are  locally sup­
              ported.  Once an authentication type  is  accepted,
              an  authentication protocol will proceed by issuing
              ADAT commands.  This  option  also  disables  auto-
              login.

       -i     Turns  off  interactive  prompting  during multiple
              file transfers.

       -d     Enables debugging.

       -g     Disables file name globbing.

       -k realm
              When using Kerberos v4 authentication, gets tickets
              in realm.

       -f     Causes  credentials  to  be forwarded to the remote
              host.

       -x     Causes the client to attempt to  negotiate  encryp­
              tion  (data  and  command  protection levels ``pri­
              vate'') immediately after successfully authenticat­
              ing.

       -t     Enables packet tracing.

COMMANDS
       The  client  host  with which ftp is to communicate may be
       specified on the command line.  If this is done, ftp  will
       immediately  attempt  to  establish a connection to an FTP
       server on that host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command
       interpreter  and  await  instructions from the user.  When
       ftp is awaiting commands from the user the prompt ``ftp>''
       is  provided to the user.  The following commands are rec­
       ognized by ftp:

       ! [command] [args]]
              Invoke an interactive shell on the  local  machine.
              If  there are arguments, the first is taken to be a
              command to execute directly, with the rest  of  the
              arguments as its arguments.

       $ macro-name [args]
              Execute  the macro macro-name that was defined with
              the macdef command.  Arguments are  passed  to  the
              macro unglobbed.

       account [passwd]
              Supply a supplemental password required by a remote
              system for access to resources  once  a  login  has
              been  successfully  completed.   If  no argument is
              included, the user will be prompted for an  account
              password in a non-echoing input mode.

       append local-file [remote-file]
              Append  a  local  file  to  a  file  on  the remote
              machine.  If remote-file is left  unspecified,  the
              local  file  name is used in naming the remote file
              after being altered by any ntrans or nmap  setting.
              File  transfer  uses the current settings for type,
              format, mode, and structure.

       ascii  Set the file transfer type to network ASCII .  This
              is the default type.

       bell   Arrange  that  a  bell  be  sounded after each file
              transfer command is completed.

       binary Set the file transfer type to support  binary  file
              transfer.

       bye    Terminate  the  FTP  session with the remote server
              and exit ftp.  An end of file will  also  terminate
              the session and exit.

       case   Toggle  remote computer file name case mapping dur­
              ing mget commands.  When case  is  on  (default  is
              off),  remote  computer file names with all letters
              in upper case are written in  the  local  directory
              with the letters mapped to lower case.

       ccc    Turn  off integrity protection on the command chan­
              nel.  This command  must  be  sent  integrity  pro­
              tected,  and must be proceeded by a successful ADAT
              command.  Since turning  off  integrity  protection
              potentially  allows  an attacker to insert commands
              onto the command  channel,  some  FTP  servers  may
              refuse to honor this command.

       cd remote-directory
              Change  the working directory on the remote machine
              to remote-directory.

       cdup   Change the remote machine working directory to  the
              parent of the current remote machine working direc­
              tory.

       chmod mode file-name
              Change the permission modes of the  file  file-name
              on the remote system to mode.

       clear  Set  the  protection  level  on  data  transfers to
              ``clear''.  If no ADAT command succeeded, then this
              is the default protection level.

       close  Terminate  the  FTP session with the remote server,
              and return to the command interpreter.  Any defined
              macros are erased.

       cprotect [protection-level]
              Set the protection level on commands to protection-
              level.  The valid protection levels  are  ``clear''
              for  unprotected  commands,  ``safe''  for commands
              integrity protected by cryptographic checksum,  and
              ``private''   for   commands   confidentiality  and
              integrity protected by encryption.  If an ADAT com­
              mand succeeded, then the default command protection
              level is  ``safe'',  otherwise  the  only  possible
              level  is ``clear''.  If no level is specified, the
              current level is printed.  cprotect clear is equiv­
              alent to the ccc command.

       cr     Toggle  carriage return stripping during ascii type
              file retrieval.  Records are denoted by a  carriage
              return/linefeed  sequence  during  ascii  type file
              transfer.  When cr is on  (the  default),  carriage
              returns  are stripped from this sequence to conform
              with the UNIX  single  linefeed  record  delimiter.
              Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain sin­
              gle linefeeds; when an ascii type transfer is made,
              these  linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
              delimiter only when cr is off.

       delete remote-file
              Delete the file remote-file on the remote  machine.

       debug [debug-value]
              Toggle  debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value
              is specified it is used to set the debugging level.
              When  debugging is on, ftp prints each command sent
              to the remote machine, preceded by the string `-->'

       dir [remote-directory] [local-file]
              Print  a  listing  of the directory contents in the
              directory, remote-directory, and, optionally, plac­
              ing  the  output  in  local-file.   If  interactive
              prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify
              that  the  last argument is indeed the target local
              file for receiving dir output.  If no directory  is
              specified,  the  current  working  directory on the
              remote machine is used.  If no local file is speci­
              fied,  or  local-file  is  `-', output comes to the
              terminal.

       disconnect
              A synonym for close.

       form format
              Set the file transfer form to format.  The  default
              format is ``file''.

       get remote-file [local-file]
              Retrieve  the  file remote-file and store it on the
              local machine.  If the local file name is not spec­
              ified,  it  is  given  the  same name it has on the
              remote machine, subject to alteration by  the  cur­
              rent  case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
              settings for type, form, mode,  and  structure  are
              used while transferring the file.

       glob   Toggle  filename  expansion  for mdelete, mget, and
              mput.  If globbing is turned  off  with  glob,  the
              file  name  arguments  are  taken literally and not
              expanded.  Globbing for mput is done as in  csh(1).
              For  mdelete  and  mget,  each  remote file name is
              expanded separately on the remote machine  and  the
              lists  are  not  merged.   Expansion of a directory
              name is likely to be different  from  expansion  of
              the  name  of  an  ordinary  file: the exact result
              depends on the foreign  operating  system  and  ftp
              server,  and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-
              files -' Note: mget  and  mput  are  not  meant  to
              transfer  entire directory subtrees of files.  That
              can be done by transferring a tar(1) archive of the
              subtree (in binary mode).

       hash   Toggle  hash-sign  (``#'')  printing  for each data
              block transferred.  The size of  a  data  block  is
              1024 bytes.

       help [command]
              Print  an  informative message about the meaning of
              command.  If no argument is  given,  ftp  prints  a
              list of the known commands.

       idle [seconds]
              Set  the  inactivity  timer on the remote server to
              seconds seconds.  If seconds is omitted,  the  cur­
              rent inactivity timer is printed.

       lcd [directory]
              Change  the working directory on the local machine.
              If no  directory  is  specified,  the  user's  home
              directory is used.

       ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
              Print  a  listing of the contents of a directory on
              the remote machine.  The listing includes any  sys­
              tem-dependent  information  that the server chooses
              to include; for example,  most  UNIX  systems  will
              produce output from the command `ls -l'.  (See also
              nlist.)  If remote-directory is  left  unspecified,
              the current working directory is used.  If interac­
              tive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the  user  to
              verify  that the last argument is indeed the target
              local file for receiving ls output.   If  no  local
              file  is  specified,  or  if local-file is `-', the
              output is sent to the terminal.

       macdefmacro-name
              Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the
              macro  macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline
              characters in a file or carriage returns  from  the
              terminal)  terminates macro input mode.  There is a
              limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in all
              defined  macros.   Macros  remain  defined  until a
              close command is  executed.   The  macro  processor
              interprets  `$'  and  `\' as special characters.  A
              `$' followed by a number (or numbers)  is  replaced
              by  the corresponding argument on the macro invoca­
              tion command line.  A `$' followed by an  `i'  sig­
              nals  that macro processor that the executing macro
              is to  be  looped.   On  the  first  pass  `$i'  is
              replaced by the first argument on the macro invoca­
              tion  command  line,  on  the  second  pass  it  is
              replaced  by the second argument, and so on.  A `\'
              followed by any character is replaced by that char­
              acter.  Use the `\' to prevent special treatment of
              the `$'.

       mdelete [remote-files]
              Delete remote-files on the remote machine.

       mdir remote-files local-file
              Like dir, except multiple remote files may be spec­
              ified.   If  interactive  prompting is on, ftp will
              prompt the user to verify that the last argument is
              indeed  the  target  local  file for receiving mdir
              output.

       mget remote-files
              Expand the remote-files on the remote  machine  and
              do  a  get  for  each file name thus produced.  See
              glob  for  details  on  the   filename   expansion.
              Resulting file names will then be processed accord­
              ing to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  Files  are
              transferred into the local working directory, which
              can be changed  with  `lcd  directory';  new  local
              directories  can  be  created  with `! mkdir direc­
              tory'.

       mkdir directory-name
              Make a directory on the remote machine.

       mls remote-files local-file
              Like nlist, except multiple  remote  files  may  be
              specified,  and  the  local-file must be specified.
              If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the
              user to verify that the last argument is indeed the
              target local file for receiving mls output.

       mode [mode-name]
              Set the  file  transfer  mode  to  mode-name.   The
              default mode is ``stream'' mode.

       modtime file-name
              Show  the last modification time of the file on the
              remote machine.

       mput local-files
              Expand wild cards in the list of local files  given
              as  arguments  and  do  a  put for each file in the
              resulting list.  See glob for details  of  filename
              expansion.   Resulting file names will then be pro­
              cessed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

       newer file-name
              Get the file only if the modification time  of  the
              remote  file  is  more  recent that the file on the
              current system.  If the file does not exist on  the
              current  system,  the  remote  file  is  considered
              newer.  Otherwise, this  command  is  identical  to
              get.

       nlist [remote-directory] [local-file]
              Print  a  list  of  the files in a directory on the
              remote  machine.   If  remote-directory   is   left
              unspecified, the current working directory is used.
              If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the
              user to verify that the last argument is indeed the
              target local file for receiving nlist  output.   If
              no  local  file  is  specified, or if local-file is
              `-', the output is sent to the terminal.

       nmap [inpattern outpattern]
              Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no
              arguments are specified, the filename mapping mech­
              anism is unset.  If arguments are specified, remote
              filenames  are  mapped during mput commands and put
              commands issued without a specified  remote  target
              filename.   If arguments are specified, local file­
              names are mapped during mget commands and get  com­
              mands issued without a specified local target file­
              name.  This command is useful  when  connecting  to
              non-UNIX remote computer with different file naming
              conventions or practices.  The mapping follows  the
              pattern  set  by inpattern and outpattern.  [Inpat­
              tern] is a template for incoming  filenames  (which
              may  have  already  been processed according to the
              ntrans and case settings).  Variable templating  is
              accomplished by including the sequences `$1', `$2',
              ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\'  to  prevent  this
              special  treatment of the `$' character.  All other
              characters are treated literally, and are  used  to
              determine  the  nmap  [inpattern]  variable values.
              For example, given inpattern $1.$2 and  the  remote
              file  name  "mydata.data",  $1 would have the value
              "mydata", and $2 would have the value "data".   The
              outpattern  determines  the  resulting mapped file­
              name.  The sequences  `$1',  `$2',  inpattern  tem­
              plate.   The sequence `$0' is replace by the origi­
              nal filename.  Additionally, the  sequence  `[seq1,
              seq2]'  is replaced by [seq1] if seq1 is not a null
              string; otherwise it  is  replaced  by  seq2.   For
              example, the command

                   nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

              would  yield  the output filename "myfile.data" for
              input       filenames       "myfile.data"       and
              "myfile.data.old",   "myfile.file"  for  the  input
              filename  "myfile",  and  "myfile.myfile"  for  the
              input  filename  ".myfile".  Spaces may be included
              in outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed  "s/
              *$//" > $1'.  Use the `\' character to prevent spe­
              cial treatment of the `$','[',']', and `,'  charac­
              ters.

       ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
              Set  or  unset  the  filename character translation
              mechanism.  If  no  arguments  are  specified,  the
              filename  character translation mechanism is unset.
              If arguments are specified,  characters  in  remote
              filenames  are  translated during mput commands and
              put commands issued without a specified remote tar­
              get  filename.  If arguments are specified, charac­
              ters in local filenames are translated during  mget
              commands  and  get commands issued without a speci­
              fied local target filename.  This command is useful
              when  connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer with
              different file  naming  conventions  or  practices.
              Characters  in  a  filename matching a character in
              inchars are replaced with the corresponding charac­
              ter  in  outchars.   If the character's position in
              inchars is longer than the length of outchars,  the
              character is deleted from the file name.

       open host [port] [-forward]
              Establish  a  connection  to the specified host FTP
              server.  An optional port number may  be  supplied,
              in  which  case, ftp will attempt to contact an FTP
              server at  that  port.   If  the  auto-authenticate
              option is on (default), ftp will attempt to authen­
              ticate to the FTP server by sending the  AUTH  com­
              mand,  using  whichever  authentication types which
              are locally supported.  Once an authentication type
              is  accepted,  an authentication protocol will pro­
              ceed by issuing ADAT commands.  If  the  auto-login
              option  is  on  (default), ftp will also attempt to
              automatically log the user in  to  the  FTP  server
              (see  below).  If the -forward option is specified,
              ftp will forward a  copy  of  the  user's  Kerberos
              tickets to the remote host.

       passive
              Toggle  passive data transfer mode off.  In passive
              mode, the client initiates the data  connection  by
              connecting to the data port.  Passive mode is often
              necessary for operation from behind firewalls which
              do not permit incoming connections, but may need to
              be disabled if you connect to an FTP  server  which
              does not support passive operation.

       private
              Set  the  protection  level  on  data  transfers to
              ``private''.  Data transmissions are  confidential­
              ity  and  integrity protected by encryption.  If no
              ADAT command  succeeded,  then  the  only  possible
              level is ``clear''.

       prompt Toggle  interactive prompting.  Interactive prompt­
              ing occurs during multiple file transfers to  allow
              the  user  to  selectively retrieve or store files.
              If prompting is turned off  (default  is  on),  any
              mget  or  mput  will  transfer  all  files, and any
              mdelete will delete all files.

       protect [protection-level]
              Set the protection level on data transfers to  pro­
              tection-level.   The  valid  protection  levels are
              ``clear''  for  unprotected   data   transmissions,
              ``safe'' for data transmissions integrity protected
              by cryptographic checksum, and ``private'' for data
              transmissions  confidentiality  and  integrity pro­
              tected by encryption.   If  no  ADAT  command  suc­
              ceeded,  then the only possible level is ``clear''.
              If no level is  specified,  the  current  level  is
              printed.    The   default   protection   level   is
              ``clear''.

       proxy ftp-command
              Execute an ftp command on a secondary control  con­
              nection.     This   command   allows   simultaneous
              connection to two remote ftp servers for  transfer­
              ring  files  between  the  two  servers.  The first
              proxy command should be an open , to establish  the
              secondary  control  connection.   Enter the command
              "proxy ?" to see other ftp commands  executable  on
              the  secondary  connection.  The following commands
              behave differently when  prefaced  by  proxy:  open
              will  not  define  new macros during the auto-login
              process, close will not erase existing macro  defi­
              nitions,  get and mget transfer files from the host
              on the primary control connection to  the  host  on
              the  secondary  control  connection, and put, mput,
              and append transfer files from the host on the sec­
              ondary  control  connection to the host on the pri­
              mary control connection.  Third party  file  trans­
              fers  depend  upon support of the ftp protocol PASV
              command by the server on the secondary control con­
              nection.

       put local-file [remote-file]
              Store  a  local  file  on  the  remote machine.  If
              remote-file is left  unspecified,  the  local  file
              name  is  used  after  processing  according to any
              ntrans or nmap settings in naming the remote  file.
              File  transfer  uses the current settings for type,
              format, mode, and structure.

       pwd    Print the name of the current working directory  on
              the remote machine.

       quit   A synonym for bye.

       quote arg1 [arg2] [...]
              The  arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the
              remote FTP server.

       recv remote-file [local-file]
              A synonym for get.

       reget remote-file [local-file]
              Reget acts like  get,  except  that  if  local-file
              exists  and is smaller than remote-file, local-file
              is presumed to be a partially transferred  copy  of
              remote-file  and the transfer is continued from the
              apparent point of failure.  This command is  useful
              when  transferring  very  large files over networks
              that are prone to dropping connections.

       remotehelp [command-name]
              Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a com­
              mand-name is specified it is supplied to the server
              as well.

       remotestatus [file-name]
              With no arguments, show status of  remote  machine.
              If file-name is specified, show status of file-name
              on remote machine.

       rename [from] [to]
              Rename the file from on the remote machine, to  the
              file to.

       reset  Clear  reply  queue.   This command re-synchronizes
              command/reply  sequencing  with  the   remote   ftp
              server.  Resynchronization may be necessary follow­
              ing a violation of the ftp protocol by  the  remote
              server.

       restart marker
              Restart the immediately following get or put at the
              indicated marker.  On UNIX systems, marker is  usu­
              ally a byte offset into the file.

       rmdir directory-name
              Delete a directory on the remote machine.

       runique
              Toggle  storing  of  files on the local system with
              unique filenames.  If a file already exists with  a
              name  equal  to the target local filename for a get
              or mget command, a ".1" is appended  to  the  name.
              If  the  resulting  name  matches  another existing
              file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.   If
              this  process  continues up to ".99", an error mes­
              sage is printed, and the  transfer  does  not  take
              place.   The  generated  unique  filename  will  be
              reported.  Note that runique will not affect  local
              files  generated  from a shell command (see below).
              The default value is off.

       safe   Set the  protection  level  on  data  transfers  to
              ``safe''.   Data  transmissions  are integrity-pro­
              tected by cryptographic checksum.  If no ADAT  com­
              mand  succeeded,  then  the  only possible level is
              ``clear''.

       send local-file [remote-file]
              A synonym for put.

       sendport
              Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By  default,  ftp
              will  attempt to use a PORT command when establish­
              ing a connection for each data transfer.   The  use
              of PORT commands can prevent delays when performing
              multiple  file  transfers.   If  the  PORT  command
              fails,  ftp  will  use the default data port.  When
              the use of PORT commands is  disabled,  no  attempt
              will  be  made  to  use PORT commands for each data
              transfer.  This is useful for certain FTP implemen­
              tations  which  do ignore PORT commands but, incor­
              rectly, indicate they've been accepted.

       site arg1 [arg2] [...]
              The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to  the
              remote FTP server as a SITE command.

       size file-name
              Return size of file-name on remote machine.

       status Show the current status of ftp.

       struct struct-name
              Set the file transfer structure to struct-name.  By
              default ``stream'' structure is used.

       sunique
              Toggle storing of files  on  remote  machine  under
              unique  file names.  Remote ftp server must support
              ftp protocol STOU command  for  successful  comple­
              tion.   The  remote server will report unique name.
              Default value is off.

       system Show the type of operating system  running  on  the
              remote machine.

       tenex  Set  the  file transfer type to that needed to talk
              to TENEX machines.

       trace  Toggle packet tracing.

       type [type-name]
              Set the file transfer type  to  type-name.   If  no
              type  is  specified,  the  current type is printed.
              The default type is network ASCII.

       umask [newmask]
              Set the default umask on the remote server to  new­
              mask.   If newmask is omitted, the current umask is
              printed.

       user user-name [password] [account]
              Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the
              password  is  not specified and the server requires
              it, ftp will prompt the user  for  it  (after  dis­
              abling  local  echo).   If  an account field is not
              specified, and the FTP server requires it, the user
              will  be  prompted  for it.  If an account field is
              specified, an account command will  be  relayed  to
              the  remote server after the login sequence is com­
              pleted if the remote server did not require it  for
              logging  in.   Unless  ftp  is invoked with ``auto-
              login'' disabled, this process  is  done  automati­
              cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

       verbose
              Toggle   verbose   mode.    In  verbose  mode,  all
              responses from the FTP server are displayed to  the
              user.   In  addition, if verbose is on, when a file
              transfer completes, statistics regarding the  effi­
              ciency  of  the transfer are reported.  By default,
              verbose is on.

        ? [command]
              A synonym for help.

       Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted
       with quote `"' marks.

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER
       To  abort  a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key
       (usually Ctrl-C).  Sending transfers will  be  immediately
       halted.   Receiving  transfers will be halted by sending a
       FTP protocol ABOR command to the remote server,  and  dis­
       carding  any  further  data  received.  The speed at which
       this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's sup­
       port  for  ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not
       support the ABOR command, an `ftp>' prompt will not appear
       until   the   remote  server  has  completed  sending  the
       requested file.

       The terminal interrupt key sequence will be  ignored  when
       ftp  has  completed any local processing and is awaiting a
       reply from the remote server.  A long delay in  this  mode
       may  result  from  the ABOR processing described above, or
       from unexpected behavior by the remote  server,  including
       violations of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from
       unexpected remote server behavior, the local  ftp  program
       must be killed by hand.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
       Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed
       according to the following rules.

       1.     If the file name `-' is specified, stdin (for read­
              ing) or stdout (for writing) is used.

       2.     If the first character of the file name is `|', the
              remainder of the argument is interpreted as a shell
              command.   Ftp  then  forks a shell, using popen(3)
              with the argument supplied, and reads from  (writes
              to)  stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes
              spaces, the argument must be quoted; e.g.   ``"  ls
              -lt"''.   A  particularly  useful  example  of this
              mechanism is: ``dir more''.

       3.     Failing  the  above  checks,  if  ``globbing''   is
              enabled, local file names are expanded according to
              the rules used in csh(1); c.f.  the  glob  command.
              If  the  ftp  command  expects  a single local file
              (.e.g.  put), only the first filename generated  by
              the ``globbing'' operation is used.

       4.     For mget commands and get commands with unspecified
              local file names, the local filename is the  remote
              filename,  which  may be altered by a case, ntrans,
              or nmap setting.  The resulting filename  may  then
              be altered if runique is on.

       5.     For mput commands and put commands with unspecified
              remote file names, the remote filename is the local
              filename,  which may be altered by a ntrans or nmap
              setting.   The  resulting  filename  may  then   be
              altered by the remote server if sunique is on.

FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS
       The  FTP specification specifies many parameters which may
       affect a file transfer.  The type may be one of ``ascii'',
       ``image''  (binary),  ``ebcdic'',  and ``local byte size''
       (mostly for PDP-10's  and  PDP-20's).   Ftp  supports  the
       ascii  and  image  types of file transfer, plus local byte
       size 8 for tenex mode transfers.

       Ftp supports only the default  values  for  the  remaining
       file transfer parameters: mode, form, and struct.

THE .netrc FILE
       The .netrc file contains login and initialization informa­
       tion used by the auto-login process.  It  resides  in  the
       user's  home  directory.   The following tokens are recog­
       nized; they may be separated  by  spaces,  tabs,  or  new-
       lines:

       machine name
              Identify  a  remote  machine  name.  The auto-login
              process searches the  .netrc  file  for  a  machine
              token  that matches the remote machine specified on
              the ftp command line or as an  open  command  argu­
              ment.   Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc
              tokens are processed, stopping when the end of file
              is reached or another machine or a default token is
              encountered.

       default
              This is  the  same  as  machine  name  except  that
              default  matches  any  name.  There can be only one
              default token, and it must  be  after  all  machine
              tokens.  This is normally used as:

                   default login anonymous password user@site

              thereby  giving  the  user  automatic anonymous ftp
              login to machines not specified  in  .netrc.   This
              can  be  overridden by using the -n flag to disable
              auto-login.

       login name
              Identify a user on the  remote  machine.   If  this
              token  is present, the auto-login process will ini­
              tiate a login using the specified name.

       password string
              Supply a password.  If this token is  present,  the
              auto-login process will supply the specified string
              if the remote server requires a password as part of
              the login process.  Note that if this token is pre­
              sent in the .netrc file for  any  user  other  than
              anonymous, ftp will abort the auto-login process if
              the .netrc is readable by anyone besides the  user.

       account string
              Supply  an  additional  account  password.  If this
              token is present, the auto-login process will  sup­
              ply  the  specified  string  if  the  remote server
              requires an additional  account  password,  or  the
              auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if
              it does not.

       macdef name
              Define a macro.  This token functions like the  ftp
              macdef  command functions.  A macro is defined with
              the specified name; its  contents  begin  with  the
              next  .netrc  line  and  continue until a null line
              (consecutive new-line characters)  is  encountered.
              If  a  macro named init is defined, it is automati­
              cally executed as the last step in  the  auto-login
              process.

ENVIRONMENT
       Ftp utilizes the following environment variables.

       HOME   For  default  location  of  a  .netrc  file, if one
              exists.

       SHELL  For default shell.

HISTORY
       The ftp command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
       Correct  execution  of  many  commands depends upon proper
       behavior by the remote server.

       An error in the  treatment  of  carriage  returns  in  the
       4.2BSD  ascii-mode transfer code has been corrected.  This
       correction may result in  incorrect  transfers  of  binary
       files  to  and  from  4.2BSD servers using the ascii type.
       Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.
