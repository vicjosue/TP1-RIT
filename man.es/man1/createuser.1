NAME
       createuser - define a new PostgreSQL user account

SYNOPSIS
       createuser [ options... ] [ username ]

   INPUTS
       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server is running. If host begins with a slash,  it
              is  used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port  or  local  Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -e, --echo
              Echo the  queries  that  createuser  generates  and
              sends to the server.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display a response.

       -d, --createdb
              Allows the new user to create databases.

       -D, --no-createdb
              Forbids the new user to create databases.

       -a, --adduser
              Allows the new user to create other users.

       -A, --no-adduser
              Forbids the new user to create other users.

       -P, --pwprompt
              If  given,  createuser  will issue a prompt for the
              password of the new user. This is not necessary  if
              you do not plan on using password authentication.

       -i, --sysid uid
              Allows  you  to  pick a non-default user id for the
              new user. This is not necessary,  but  some  people
              like it.

       -E, --encrypted
              Encrypts   the   user's   password  stored  in  the
              database. If not specified, the default is used.

       -N, --unencrypted
              Does not encrypt the user's password stored in  the
              database. If not specified, the default is used.

       username
              Specifies  the  name  of  the PostgreSQL user to be
              created.  This name must be unique among all  Post­
              greSQL users.

       You will be prompted for a name and other missing informa­
       tion if it is not specified on the command line.

       The options -h, -p, and -e, are  passed  on  literally  to
       psql(1). The psql options -U and -W are available as well,
       but their use can be confusing in this context.

   OUTPUTS
       CREATE USER
              All is well.

       createuser: creation of user "username" failed
              Something went wrong. The user was not created.

       If there is an error condition, the backend error  message
       will  be  displayed.  See CREATE USER [create_user(7)] and
       psql(1) for possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       createuser creates a new PostgreSQL user.  Only users with
       usesuper  set  in the pg_shadow table can create new Post­
       greSQL users.

       createuser is a shell script wrapper around the  SQL  com­
       mand  CREATE  USER  [create_user(7)]  via  the  PostgreSQL
       interactive terminal psql(1). Thus, there is nothing  spe­
       cial  about creating users via this or other methods. This
       means that the psql must be found by the script and that a
       database server is running at the targeted host. Also, any
       default settings and environment  variables  available  to
       psql and the libpq front-end library do apply.

USAGE
       To create a user joe on the default database server:

       $ createuser joe
       Is the new user allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
       Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n
       CREATE USER



       To create the same user joe using the server on host eden,
       port 5000, avoiding the prompts and taking a look  at  the
       underlying query:

       $ createuser -p 5000 -h eden -D -A -e joe
       CREATE USER "joe" NOCREATEDB NOCREATEUSER
       CREATE USER
