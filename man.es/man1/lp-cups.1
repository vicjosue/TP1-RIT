DESCRIPTION
       lp submits files for printing or alters a pending job.

       cancel cancels existing print jobs.  The  -a  option  will
       remove all jobs from the specified destination.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lp:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -d destination
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -h hostname
            Specifies  the  print server hostname. The default is
            "localhost" or the value of the CUPS_SERVER  environ­
            ment variable.

       -i job-id
            Specifies an existing job to modify.

       -m
            Send  email  when the job is completed (not supported
            CUPS 1.1.)

       -n copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -o option
            Sets a job option.

       -q priority
            Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to  100  (high­
            est). The default priority is 50.

       -s
            Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent mode.)

       -t name
            Sets the job name.

       -H handling
            Specifies  when the job should be printed. A value of
            immediate will print the file immediately, a value of
            hold will hold the job indefinitely, and a time value
            (HH:MM) will hold the job until the  specified  time.
            Use  a value of resume with the -i option to resume a
            held job.

       -P page-list
            Specifies which pages to print in the  document.  The
            list  can  contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#)
            separated by commas (e.g. 1,3-5,16).

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS  allows  printer
       names  to contain any printable character except SPACE and
       TAB. Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The "m" option is not functional in CUPS 1.1.

       The  "q"  option  accepts a different range of values than
       the Solaris lp command, matching the IPP job priority val­
       ues (1-100) instead of the Solaris values (0-39).
