NAME
       pgmnorm - normalize the contrast in a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       pgmnorm  [-bpercent  N | -bvalue N] [-wpercent N | -wvalue
       N] [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable graymap as input.   Normalizes  the  con­
       trast by forcing the lightest pixels to white, the darkest
       pixels to  black,  and  linearly  rescaling  the  ones  in
       between; and produces a portable graymap as output.

OPTIONS
       By default, the darkest 2 percent of all pixels are mapped
       to black, and the lightest 1 percent are mapped to  white.
       You  can override these percentages by using the -bpercent
       and -wpercent flags, or you can specify  the  exact  pixel
       values  to  be  mapped  by  using  the -bvalue and -wvalue
       flags.  Appropriate numbers for the flags  can  be  gotten
       from  the  pgmhist  tool.  If you just want to enhance the
       contrast, then choose values at elbows in  the  histogram;
       e.g.  if  value 29 represents 3% of the image but value 30
       represents 20%, choose 30 for  bvalue.   If  you  want  to
       lighten  the  image,  then set bvalue to 0 and just fiddle
       with wvalue; similarly, to darken the image, set wvalue to
       maxval and play with bvalue.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique pre­
       fix.
