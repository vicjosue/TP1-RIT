NAME
       initlog - log messages and events to the system logger

SYNOPSIS
       initlog  [-cefnpqrs]  [--cmd=ARG]  [--event=ARG] [--facil­
       ity=ARG]   [--name=ARG]    [--priority=ARG]    [--run=ARG]
       [--string=ARG]

DESCRIPTION
       initlog logs messages and events to the system logger.  It
       is mainly designed for use in init scripts. initlog  reads
       a  configuration  file  /etc/initlog.conf  by  default, to
       determine its settings. Any line preceded with a  #  is  a
       comment,  and  the  following configuration directives are
       recognized:

       facility <logging facility>
              Sets the default logging facility

       priority <logging priority>
              Sets the default logging priority

       ignore <regexp>
              Messages that match the regular expression will not
              be logged.

       initlog  behavior  can  also be configured by command-line
       options.


   OPTIONS
       -c, --cmd=[program]
              Execute  the  specified  program,  logging anything
              output to stdout or stderr.

       -e, --event=[number]
              Logs that the specified  event  happened.  Used  in
              conjuction  with --name. Currently specified events
              are:
               1  the action completed successfully
               2  the action failed
               3  the action was cancelled at user request
               4  the action failed due to the failure of a dependent action

       -f, --facility=[facility]

              Log at the specified syslog facility. The default
              is daemon (see syslog(3)).

       -n, --name=[string]
              Log the event under the specified string, such as
              "inetd".

       -p, --priority=[priority]
              Log at the specified syslog priority. The default
              is notice (see syslog(3)).

       -q     Do not print the program's output, unless it exits
              with a non-zero exit code.

       -r, --run=[program]
              Execute the specified program, with an open file
              descriptor so that the program can pass back
              commands to initlog.

       -s, --string=[string]
              Log the specified string to the logger.

       --conf=[file]
              Specifies an alternate configuration file.
