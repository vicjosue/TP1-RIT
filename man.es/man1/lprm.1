NAME
       lprm - cancel print jobs

SYNOPSIS
       lprm [ -E ] [ - ] [ -P destination ] [ job ID(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lprm  cancels  print jobs that have been queued for print­
       ing. The -P option specifies the  destination  printer  or
       class.

       If  no  arguments  are  supplied,  the  current job on the
       default destination is cancelled. You can specify  one  or
       more  job  ID  numbers  to cancel those jobs, or use the -
       option to cancel all jobs.

       The -E option forces encryption  when  connecting  to  the
       server.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  CUPS  version of lprm is compatible with the standard
       Berkeley lprm command.
