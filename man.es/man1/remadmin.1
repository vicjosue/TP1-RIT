NAME
       remadmin - generic graphical user interface

SYNOPSIS
       remadmin [ --exec command options ]

DESCRIPTION
       remadmin  locates  one  GUI  front-end  for Linuxconf (and
       other programs using the Linuxconf UI toolkit) and  starts
       it.  At this time, there are 2 implementations: gnome-lin­
       uxconf and wxxt-linuxconf.  remadmin  locate  one  or  the
       other  and execute it, passing along all received options.


BACK-END OPERATION
       When Linuxconf starts, it  executes  remadmin  to  find  a
       suitable  UI  front-end (not only GUI front-end). remadmin
       tries to locate one. If one is available, it starts it and
       linuxconf starts using it.

       If  no  UI front-end is available, it returns a small mes­
       sage.  Linuxconf  starts  its  builtin  text  mode  (using
       ncurses) user interface.

       In  this  case, we call it a back-end, because the user is
       not aware of this process. The user runs Linuxconf and  it
       operates as a graphical program.


FRONT-END OPERATION
       In  this case, this is the GUI front-end which starts Lin­
       uxconf (or any program made with Linuxconf UI toolkit). In
       this  case,  Linuxconf  has  to be told how it was started
       (using the --guiproto option).  Unless it is told, it will
       tru to connect to a back-end.

       Front-end  operation is done using the --exec command line
       option like this:

       remadmin --exec linuxconf --guiproto

       The most common usage is:

       remadmin  --exec  ssh  -l  some_user  some_host  linuxconf
       --guiproto


       This  create  a  GUI relation where the GUI component runs
       locally  and  Linuxconf  runs  remotly,  accross  a  fully
       encripted  link  (using  ssh,  the secure shell).  The GUI
       protocol is very light. It works  very  well  on  slow  or
       overloaded links.
