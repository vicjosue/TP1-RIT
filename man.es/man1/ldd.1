NAME
       ldd - print shared library dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       ldd [OPTION]...  FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       ldd  prints  the shared libraries required by each program
       or shared library specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the version number of ldd.

       -v --verbose
              Print all information.

       -d --data-relocs
              Perform relocations and report  any  missing  func­
              tions (ELF only).

       -r --function-relocs
              Perform relocations for both data objects and func­
              tions, and report any missing objects (ELF only).

       --help Usage information.

BUGS
       ldd does not work very well on libc.so.5 itself.

       ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       ldd does not work with some extremely old  a.out  programs
       which  were built before ldd support was added to the com­
       piler releases.  If you use ldd on one of these  programs,
       the  program  will  attempt  to  run with argc = 0 and the
       results will be unpredictable.
