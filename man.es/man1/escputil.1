NAME
       escputil - maintain Epson Stylus inkjet printers

SYNOPSIS
       escputil [-P printer  -r device] [-m model] [-u] [-c  -n |
       -a  -i] [-q]


DESCRIPTION
       escputil is a command  line  utility  to  perform  various
       maintenance  tasks on Epson Stylus inkjet printers.  These
       tasks include head alignment, head cleaning, nozzle check,
       printer  identification,  and  retrieval of ink level from
       the printer.


OPTIONS
       escputil accepts the following options:

       -P, --printer-name <printer>
               Specify the name of the  printer  to  operate  on.
               Default is the default system printer.

       -r, --raw-device <device>
               Specify  the  name  of  the  device  to  write  to
               directly  rather  than  going  through  a  printer
               queue. You must use this (rather than specifying a
               printer) when retrieving ink levels or identifying
               the printer, or if you wish to perform head align­
               ment without specifying the printer model.

       -c, --clean-head
               Clean the print head.  This can also be  performed
               from the printer front panel.

       -n, --nozzle-check
               Print  a  nozzle  test  pattern.  Dirty or clogged
               nozzles will show as gaps in the pattern.  If  you
               see  any gaps, you should run a head cleaning pass
               or two.

       -a, --align-head
               Align the print head.   CAUTION:  Misuse  of  this
               utility  may  result  in poor print quality and/or
               damage to the printer.  You  must  either  specify
               the  printer  model with the -m option, or use the
               raw printer device to allow escputil to detect the
               printer model.

       -i, --ink-level
               Obtain  the  ink  level  from  the  printer.  This
               requires read/write  access  to  the  raw  printer
               device.

       -d, --identify
               Query  the printer for make and model information.
               This requires read/write access to the raw printer
               device.

       -u      The printer is connected via USB.

       -h, --help
               Display a list of all commandline options.

       -q, --quiet
               Suppress the banner.

       -m <model>
               Specify  the precise printer model for head align­
               ment.

BUGS
       USB-connected  printers  sometimes  fail  to  identify  or
       return ink levels.  You may have to  repeat  the  command.
       This is probably a timing issue in escputil, not a flaw in
       the printer.


       Anything requiring bidirectional  communication  with  the
       printer  (identify,  ink levels, or head alignment without
       specifying the printer model) requires  read/write  access
       to  the  printer  port  (for  example /dev/lp0).  This may
       require these operations to be performed as root.


       If the printer is performing self-test or head cleaning on
       power  up,  the  identify and ink level commands will time
       out, although the printer successfully receives  the  com­
       mand.   The  command  will  need  to  be reissued when the
       printer is quiescent.
