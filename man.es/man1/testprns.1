TESTPRNS(1)                                           TESTPRNS(1)



NAME
       testprns - check printer name for validity with smbd

SYNOPSIS
       testprns printername [ printcapname ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       testprns  is  a  very  simple  test  program  to determine
       whether a given printer name is valid for use in a service
       to be provided by  smbd(8).

       "Valid"  in this context means "can be found in the print­
       cap specified". This program is very stupid - so stupid in
       fact  that it would be wisest to always specify the print­
       cap file to use.

OPTIONS
       printername
              The printer name to validate.

              Printer names are taken from  the  first  field  in
              each  record  in  the printcap file, single printer
              names and sets of  aliases  separated  by  vertical
              bars ("|") are recognized.  Note that no validation
              or checking of the printcap syntax is  done  beyond
              that  required  to extract the printer name. It may
              be that the print spooling system is more forgiving
              or  less forgiving than testprns. However, if test­
              prns finds the printer then smbd should  do  so  as
              well.

       printcapname
              This  is the name of the printcap file within which
              to search for the given printer name.

              If no printcap  name  is  specified  testprns  will
              attempt to scan the printcap file name specified at
              compile time.

FILES
       /etc/printcap
              This is usually the default printcap file to  scan.
              See printcap (5).

DIAGNOSTICS
       If  a  printer  is found to be valid, the message "Printer
       name <printername> is valid" will be displayed.

       If a printer is found to be invalid, the message  "Printer
       name <printername> is not valid" will be displayed.

       All  messages  that would normally be logged during opera­
       tion of the Samba daemons are logged by  this  program  to
       the  file  test.log  in the current directory. The program
       runs at debuglevel 3, so quite extensive logging  informa­
       tion  is  written. The log should be checked carefully for
       errors and warnings.

       Other messages are self-explanatory.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for  version  2.2  of  the  Samba
       suite.

AUTHOR
       The  original  Samba  software  and related utilities were
       created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by  the
       Samba  Team  as  an Open Source project similar to the way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written  by  Karl  Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another excellent piece of Open Source  software,  avail­
       able           at          ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba  2.0  release  by  Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
