NAME
       xmlcatalog - Command line tool to parse and manipulate XML
       or
             SGML catalog files.

SYNOPSIS
       xmlcatalog [--shell | --create | --add  type          orig
       replace  | --del  values  | --noout | --verbose] [catalog­
       file] [entities]

INTRODUCTION
       xmlcatalog is a command line application allowing users to
       monitor  and  manipulate  XML  and  SGML  catalogs.  It is
       included in libxml2.


       Its functions can be invoked from a  single  command  from
       the  command line, or it can perform multiple functions in
       interactive mode. It can operate  on  both  XML  and  SGML
       files.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       --shell filename

              Run a shell allowing interactive queries on catalog
              file filename.


       --create filename

              Create a new XML catalog. Outputs to stdout, ignor­
              ing  filename unless --noout is used, in which case
              it creates a new catalog file filename.


       --add 'type' 'orig' 'replace' filename

              Add an entry to catalog file filename.  type  indi­
              cates  the  type of entry. Possible types are 'pub­
              lic', 'system',  'rewriteSystem',  'delegatePublic'
              and 'delegateSystem'. 'orig' is the original refer­
              ence to be replaced, and 'replace' is  the  URI  of
              the replacement entity to be used. The --add option
              will not overwrite filename, outputing  to  stdout,
              unless  --noout is used. The --add will always take
              three parameters even if some of  the  XML  catalog
              constructs will have only a single argument.


              If  the  --add  option is used following the --sgml
              option, only a  single  argument,  a  filename,  is
              used.  This  is  used  to add the name of a catalog
              file to an SGML supercatalog, a file that  contains
              references to other included SGML catalog files.


       --del 'values' filename

              Remove  entries  from  the  catalog  file  filename
              matching 'values'. The --del option will not  over­
              write filename, outputing to stdout, unless --noout
              is used.


       --noout

              Save output to the named file rather than outputing
              to stdout.


       -v or --verbose

              output debugging information.


SHELL COMMANDS
       Invoking xmlcatalog with the --shell filename option opens
       a command line shell allowing interactive  access  to  the
       catalog  file  identified  by filename. Invoking the shell
       provides a command line prompt after which commands can be
       entered.


       public 'PublicID'

              Execute  a  public identifier lookup of the catalog
              entry for 'PublicID'. The corresponding entry  will
              be output to the command line.


       system 'SystemID'

              Execute  a  public identifier lookup of the catalog
              entry for 'SystemID'. The corresponding entry  will
              be output to the command line.


       add  'type' 'orig' 'replace'

              Add  an  entry  to the catalog file. type indicates
              the type of entry.  Possible  types  are  'public',
              'system',   'rewriteSystem',  'delegatePublic'  and
              'delegateSystem'. 'orig' is the original  reference
              to  be  replaced,  and  'replace' is the URI of the
              replacement entity to be used.


       del 'values'

              Remove the catalog entry corresponding to 'values'.


       dump    Print the current catalog.


       debug    Print debugging statements showing the steps xml­
              catalog is executing.


       quiet   Stop printing debugging statements.


       exit    Quit the shell.
