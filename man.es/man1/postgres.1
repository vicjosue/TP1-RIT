DESCRIPTION
       The  postgres  executable  is the actual PostgreSQL server
       process that processes queries. It is normally not  called
       directly;  instead  a  postmaster(1)  multi-user server is
       started.

       The second form above is how postgres is  invoked  by  the
       postmaster(1)  (only  conceptually,  since both postmaster
       and postgres are in fact the same program); it should  not
       be  invoked  directly this way. The first form invokes the
       server directly in interactive single-user mode. The  pri­
       mary   use  for  this  mode  is  during  bootstrapping  by
       initdb(1).  Sometimes it is used for debugging or disaster
       recovery.

       When  invoked in interactive mode from the shell, the user
       can enter queries and the results will be printed  to  the
       screen,  but  in a form that is more useful for developers
       than end users. But note that running a single-user  back­
       end  is  not truly suitable for debugging the server since
       no realistic interprocess communication and  locking  will
       happen.

       When  running a stand-alone backend, the session user will
       be set to the user with id 1. This user does not  actually
       have  to  exist,  so  a stand-alone backend can be used to
       manually recover from certain kinds of  accidental  damage
       to  the  system  catalogs.  Implicit  superuser powers are
       granted to the user with id 1 in stand-alone mode.

   OPTIONS
       When postgres is started by a postmaster(1) then it inher­
       its all options set by the latter. Additionally, postgres-
       specific options can be passed from  the  postmaster  with
       the -o switch.

       You can avoid having to type these options by setting up a
       configuration file.  See  the  Administrator's  Guide  for
       details. Some (safe) options can also be set from the con­
       necting client in an application-dependent way.  For exam­
       ple,  if  the  environment variable PGOPTIONS is set, then
       libpq-based clients will pass that string to  the  server,
       which  will interpret it as postgres command-line options.

   GENERAL PURPOSE
       The options -A, -B, -c, -d, -D, -F, and  --name  have  the
       same meanings as for the postmaster(1).

       -e     Sets  the default date style to ``European'', which
              means that the ``day before  month''  (rather  than
              month before day) rule is used to interpret ambigu­
              ous date input, and that the day is printed  before
              the  month  in certain date output formats. See the
              PostgreSQL User's Guide for more information.

       -o filename
              Sends all debugging and error output  to  filename.
              If  the  backend  is  running under the postmaster,
              this option is ignored, and  the  stderr  inherited
              from the postmaster is used.

       -P     Ignore  system indexes while scanning/updating sys­
              tem  tuples.  The  REINDEX   command   for   system
              tables/indexes requires this option to be used.

       -s     Print  time information and other statistics at the
              end of each query.  This is useful for benchmarking
              or for use in tuning the number of buffers.

       -S sort-mem
              Specifies the amount of memory to be used by inter­
              nal sorts and hashes before resorting to  temporary
              disk  files.  The  value is specified in kilobytes,
              and defaults to 512 kilobytes. Note that for a com­
              plex  query,  several  sorts and/or hashes might be
              running in parallel, and each one will  be  allowed
              to  use  as  much  as  sort-mem kilobytes before it
              starts to put data into temporary files.

   OPTIONS FOR STAND-ALONE MODE
       database
              Specifies the name of the database to be  accessed.
              If it is omitted it defaults to the user name.

       -E     Echo all queries.

       -N     Disables use of newline as a query delimiter.

   SEMI-INTERNAL OPTIONS
       There  are  several  other  options that may be specified,
       used mainly for debugging purposes. These are listed  here
       only  for  the use by PostgreSQL system developers. Use of
       any of these options is highly  discouraged.  Furthermore,
       any  of  these options may disappear or change in a future
       release without notice.

       -f { s | i | m | n | h }
              Forbids the use of particular scan and  join  meth­
              ods:  s  and  i  disable sequential and index scans
              respectively, while n, m,  and  h  disable  nested-
              loop, merge and hash joins respectively.

              Note:  Neither  sequential  scans  nor  nested-loop
              joins can be disabled completely; the -fs  and  -fn
              options  simply discourage the optimizer from using
              those plan types if it has any other alternative.


       -i     Prevents query execution, but shows the plan  tree.

       -O     Allows  the  structure of system tables to be modi­
              fied. This is used by initdb.

       -p database
              Indicates that this server has been  started  by  a
              postmaster  and  makes  different assumptions about
              buffer pool management, file descriptors, etc.

       -t pa[rser] | pl[anner] | e[xecutor]
              Print timing statistics for each query relating  to
              each  of the major system modules. This option can­
              not be used together with the -s option.

       -v protocol
              Specifies the version number of the  frontend/back­
              end  protocol  to  be used for this particular ses­
              sion.

       -W seconds
              As soon as this option is encountered, the  process
              sleeps  for  the  specified amount of seconds. This
              gives developers time to attach a debugger  to  the
              backend process.

USAGE
       Start a stand-alone backend with a command like

       postgres -D $PGDATA other-options my_database

       Provide  the correct path to the database area with -D, or
       make sure that the environment  variable  PGDATA  is  set.
       Also  specify the name of the particular database you want
       to work in.

       Normally, the stand-alone backend treats  newline  as  the
       command  entry  terminator; there is no intelligence about
       semicolons, as there is in psql.  To  continue  a  command
       across multiple lines, you must type backslash just before
       each newline except the last one.

       But if you use the -N command line  switch,  then  newline
       does  not  terminate  command entry. The backend will read
       the standard input until  the  end-of-file  (EOF)  marker,
       then  process  the  input  as a single query string. Back­
       slash-newline is not treated specially in this case.

       To quit the session, type EOF  (Control+D,  usually).   If
       you've used -N, two consecutive EOFs are needed to exit.

       Note that the stand-alone backend does not provide sophis­
       ticated line-editing features  (no  command  history,  for
       example).
