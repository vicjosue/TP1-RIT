DESCRIPTION
       Jikes translates Java(TM) source files to  bytecode.  Fea­
       tures  include strict adherence to the language specifica­
       tion, automatic makefile generation and incremental compi­
       lation. It is maintained by the Jikes Project.


OPTIONS
       Jikes  may  be  invoked  with  the  following command-line
       options:

       -bootclasspath path
              use path for the bootclasspath

       -classpath path
              use path for CLASSPATH

       -d directory
              write class files in specified directory

       -debug no effect (recognized for compatibility)

       -depend
              recompile all used classes

       -deprecation
              report uses of deprecated features

       -encoding
              use specified encoding to read source files

       -extdirs path
              use path for extensions directories

       -g     debug (generate LocalVariableTable attribute)

       -nowarn
              do not issue warning messages

       -nowrite
              do not write any class files

       -O     do not write LineNumberTable

       -sourcepath path
              use path for specifying "source only" directories

       -verbose
              list files read and written

       -Xdepend
              same as -depend

       -Xstdout
              write error messages to standard output, not stderr

       ++     compile in incremental mode

       +B     do not invoke bytecode generator

       +OLDCSO
              Select  to  use  same  classpath search order as in
              older versions of Jikes (for compatibility).

       +D     report errors  immediately  in  emacs-form  without
              buffering

       +DR=filename
              write report of dependencies to specified file

       +E     list errors in emacs-form

       +F     do  full  dependence  check  except for Zip and Jar
              files

       +Kname=TypeKeyWord
              map name to type keyword

       +M     generate makefile dependencies

       +P     Pedantic compilation - issues lots of warnings

       +Tnn   set value of tab to nn spaces

       +U     do full dependence  check  including  Zip  and  Jar
              files

       +Z     treat cautions as errors

       +c     do not discard comments from lexer output

       An  argument may have the form @file; each line of file is
       then interpreted as an argument, except that lines  begin­
       ning with @ are not expanded recursively.


FILES
       Jikes  has several options related to classpath searching.
       The -bootclasspath, -extdirs, and -sourcepath options  are
       the  same  as in javac.  In addition to being specified on
       the command line, the environment variables BOOTCLASSPATH,
       EXTDIRS, and SOURCEPATH may also be used to specify values
       for these  options,  respectively.   Jikes  also  has  the
       -classpath  option  as  in  javac,  with the corresponding
       environment variable CLASSPATH.  The classpath may also be
       specified  in  the  environment  variable  JIKESPATH.   If
       JIKESPATH and CLASSPATH coexist, preference will be  given
       to  JIKESPATH.  A value specified on the command line will
       be always be given preference over the value of any  envi­
       ronment variable.  All the directories and files specified
       in these options or environment variables  must  be  in  a
       colon-separated list, e.g., ".:$HOME/java/jre/lib/rt.jar".
