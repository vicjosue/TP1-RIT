MIKMOD(1)                                               MIKMOD(1)



NAME
       mikmod - play soundtracker etc. modules on a Unix machine.



SYNOPSIS
       mikmod [-options]... [module|playlist]...



DESCRIPTION
       MikMod is a very portable module player based  on  libmik­
       mod,  written originally by Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak). It
       will play the IT, XM, MOD, MTM, S3M, STM, ULT,  FAR,  MED,
       DSM,  AMF, IMF and 669 module formats. It works under AIX,
       FreeBSD,  HP-UX,  IRIX,  Linux,  NetBSD,  OpenBSD,  OSF/1,
       SunOS,  Solaris  and OS/2. It is controllable via an easy-
       to-use curses interface and will extract and play  modules
       from a variety of different archive formats.



OPTIONS
       Options can be given in any order, and are case-sensitive.
       For the options which have both a short and a  long  form,
       the  long  form can be prefixed by one or two dashes. Note
       that the settings in your  $HOME/.mikmodrc  will  override
       the defaults shown in this man page.



OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -d n

       --driver n
              Use  the  specified  device driver for output, 0 is
              autodetect. The default is 0.   If  your  installed
              libmikmod  engine  is  recent enough (>=3.1.7), you
              can also specify the driver with an alias, as  well
              as driver options separated by commas. The list and
              driver aliases and recognized options can be  found
              in libmikmod's documentation.

       -o[utput] 8m|8s|16m|16s
              Output settings, 8 or 16 bit in stereo or mono. The
              default is "16s".

       -f freq

       --frequency freq
              Set mixing  frequency  in  hertz.  The  default  is
              44100.

       -i

       --interpolate
              Use   interpolated   mixing.  This  will  generally
              improve audio quality, at the expense of a bit more
              CPU   usage.  Note  that  this  option  alters  the
              behaviour  of  software  drivers  only  ;  hardware
              drivers are not affected.

       --nointerpolate
              Do not use interpolated mixing (default).

       -hq

       --hqmixer
              Use  high  quality  software  mixer.  This improves
              audio quality, but requires a lot more  CPU  power.
              Note that this option alters the behaviour of soft­
              ware  drivers  only  ;  hardware  drivers  are  not
              affected.

       --nohqmixer
              Do not use high quality software mixer (default).

       -s

       --surround
              Use surround mixing.

       --nosurround
              Do not use surround mixing (default).

       -r n

       --reverb n
              Sets  reverb  amount  from 0 (no reverb) to 15 (max
              reverb). The default is 0 (no reverb).



PLAYBACK OPTIONS
       -v volume

       --volume volume
              Set volume from 0% (silence) to 100%.  The  default
              is 100%.

       -F

       --fadeout
              Fade out the volume during the last pattern of each
              module.

       --nofadeout
              Do not fade out the volume during the last  pattern
              of each module (default).

       -l

       --loops
              Enable in-module backwards loops.

       --noloops
              Disable in-module backwards loops (default).

       -a

       --panning
              Process  panning  effects (default). This should be
              disabled (using --nopanning) for very old demo mod­
              ules which use the panning effects for synchroniza­
              tion purposes.

       --nopanning
              Do not process panning effects.

       -x

       --protracker
              Enable protracker extended speed effect  (default).
              This  should be disabled (using --noprotracker) for
              very old demo modules which use the extended  speed
              effect for synchronization purposes.

       --noprotracker
              Disable protracker extended speed effect.



LOADING OPTIONS
       -c

       --curious
              Look  for  hidden  patterns in module. Most modules
              don't  have  hidden  patterns,  but  you  can  find
              "bonus" patterns (or just silence) in some modules.

       --nocurious
              Do  not  look  for  hidden   patterns   in   module
              (default).

       -p n

       --playmode n
              Playlist  mode.  The  allowed values here are 0, to
              loop the current module ;  1,  to  play  the  whole
              playlist  once  ;  2,  to  play  the whole playlist
              repeatedly, and 3, to play the whole playlist  ran­
              domly. The default is 2.

       -t

       --tolerant
              Don't  halt MikMod if a module cannot be read or is
              an unknown format.

       --notolerant
              Halt MikMod if a module cannot be  read  or  is  an
              unknown format (default).



SCHEDULING OPTIONS
       The  following  options  need root privileges (or a setuid
       root binary), and don't work under all systems.

       -s Y|N

       --renice Y|N
              Renice to -20 if possible to gain more  CPU  prior­
              ity.  This  option is only available under FreeBSD,
              Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS/2.

       --norenice
              Do not renice to -20 (default).

       -S Y|N

       --realtime Y|N
              Reschedule mikmod to gain real-time  priority  (and
              thus  more CPU time).  DANGEROUS! USE WITH CAUTION!
              This option is only available under FreeBSD,  Linux
              and OS/2.

       --norealtime
              Do not reschedule MikMod to gain real-time priority
              (default).



DISPLAY OPTIONS
       -q

       --quiet
              Quiet mode. Disables interactive commands and  dis­
              plays only errors.

       -te

       --terse
              Terse  display  like  MikMod  2,  i.e.  without the
              information panels.



INFORMATION OPTIONS
       -n

       --information
              Display the list of the known  drivers  and  module
              loaders.

       -V

       --version
              Display MikMod version.

       -h

       --help Display a summary of the options.



CONFIGURATION OPTION
       --norc Do  not  parse  the  $HOME/.mikmodrc  configuration
              file. This file contains your default settings,  so
              that  you  don't have to specify them each time you
              run MikMod. The file is read when  you  run  MikMod
              and  updated  on  exit.  Using this option prevents
              MikMod from accessing this file.

MENU BASICS
       Some functions of MikMod are available through  menus,  in
       the playlist and configuration panels.

       You  can select commands in the menus either by moving the
       selection with the  arrow  keys  and  pressing  enter,  or
       entering  the  highlighted  letter  corresponding  ot  the
       command you want to select.

       Menu entries ending with a >  character  open  a  submenu,
       whereas  entries  ending in ... open a dialog box. You can
       dismiss a submenu either by choosing  a  command  in  this
       menu, or using the left arrow key to go back, or switching
       panels.

       In dialog boxes, you can move the  focus  from  the  input
       line  to  the  Ok and Cancel buttons either with the "tab"
       key, or the up and down arrow keys.

       Also, if the statusbar is active  (which  is  the  default
       behaviour),  it  will contain a short help text describing
       the menu option currently highlighted.



PLAYLIST MENU
       When the playlist panel is displayed, pressing the  return
       key will popup a menu. The menu commands are:


       Play   Continue  list  playback  from  the currently high­
              lighted module.

       Remove Remove module from the playlist.

       Delete...
              Remove module from the playlist, and delete  module
              file  on  disk,  or  whole archive if the module is
              stored in an archive file. This function  asks  you
              to confirm your choice.

       File > This  entry  opens  a  submenu  with four commands,
              "Load", "Insert", "Save" and "Save  as".  The  Load
              and  Insert  commands  ask  you for a filename, and
              replace the playlist with it  (load)  or  merge  it
              with   the  playlist  (insert).  No  wildcards  are
              allowed. The Save and Save  as  commands  save  the
              current    playlist   in   a   file,   by   default
              ``playlist.mpl'', in the  current  directory.  Note
              that playlist filenames should end in .mpl, or they
              won't be loaded by MikMod.

       Shuffle
              Randomize the playlist.

       Sort > This entry opens a submenu with sort commands.  You
              can select a normal or reverse order, and then sort
              the playlist with one  of  the  four  criteria:  by
              name, by extension, by path or by time.

       Back   Discards the menu.



CONFIGURATION PANEL
       The  configuration  panel  lets  you customize your MikMod
       settings, and save them.  You can also try some particular
       settings without losing your previous configuration.


       Output options
              This section lets you choose various vital playback
              settings,  such   as   the   output   driver,   the
              stereo/mono and 16/8 bit output settings, the play­
              back frequency, and the software mixer settings.

       Playback options
              This section lets you choose various  module  play­
              back  settings, such as the output volume, the pro­
              cessing of panning effects and bacwards loops, etc.

       Other options
              This  section  lets  you  choose the remaining set­
              tings, such as the playlist mode, and various  pro­
              gram settings.


       Use config
              This  command  activates  the current configuration
              settings, but does not save them.

       Save config
              This command saves and activates the  current  con­
              figuration settings.

       Revert config
              This  command  reverts to the on-disk configuration
              file settings.
