DESCRIPTION
       This program accepts Photo-CD image or overview file  data
       from  the specified input file, infile (or, if the resolu­
       tion is lower than 64Base and the file argument is  speci­
       fied  as  -,  from  standard  input),  and  writes  either
       Portable Bitmap Format or POSTSCRIPT to the specified out­
       put  file (or to standard output if no file is specified).

       On  a   standard   Photo-CD,   image   files   appear   in
       photo_cd/images,  where they appear in files with names of
       the form imgnnnn.pcd, where nnnn is a 4-digit-number.  The
       overview file appears in photo_cd/overview.pcd.

       Photo-CD  images  are  stored using as many as 6 different
       resolutions:
                 Format              Resolution
                 ------              ----------
                 64Base              4096x6144 (ProPhotoCD only)
                 16Base              2048x3072
                 4Base               1024x1536
                 Base                512x768
                 Base/4              256x384
                 Base/16             128x192

       The overview file employs Base/16 format.

OPTIONS
       Invoking hpcdtoppm without arguments produces  a  list  of
       default  values.   Note  that you can supply only one size
       option.

       -a     Automatically  determine  image  orientation  (this
              option  is  experimental,  and  does  not  work for
              overview files).

       {-C | -0 | -Overview | -O } file opt
              Extract all images  from  an  overview  file.   The
              mandatory  file argument is the name of a ppm file;
              output files are named filennnn, where  nnnn  is  a
              4-digit  number.   Overview images are extracted in
              their original Base/16 format.  The  value  of  opt
              determines  the  orientation  of  the contact sheet
              image; recognized values are:

              n      Do not rotate the image.

              l      Rotate   the    picture    counter-clockwise
                     (portrait mode).

              r      Rotate   the   picture  clockwise  (portrait
                     mode).

       -c0    Do not correct (brighten or darken) the image.

       -c-    Darken the image.

       -c+    Brighten the image.

       -crop  Cut off the black frame which sometimes appears  at
              the image borders.

       -d     Show  only  the decompressed difference rather than
              the complete image (applicable only  to  4Base  and
              16Base images).

       -dpi res
              Set  the  printer  resolution  to  res for dithered
              POSTSCRIPT images.

       -eps   Write a RGB Encapsulated POSTSCRIPT color image.

       -epsd  Write a Floyd-Steinberg dithered image in  Encapsu­
              lated POSTSCRIPT.

       -epsg  Write a grayscale image in Encapsulated POSTSCRIPT.

       -fak scale
              Set the  scaling  factor  for  dithered  POSTSCRIPT
              images to scale.

       -hori  Flip the image horizontally.

       -i     Send information from an image file header to stan­
              dard error.

       -l     Rotate  the  picture  counter-clockwise   (portrait
              mode).

       -m     Write  messages  about  the  phases  of decoding to
              standard error.

       -n     Do not rotate the image.

       -pb pos
              Set the bottom position of the POSTSCRIPT image  to
              pos.

       -pgm   Write a pgm (grayscale) image.

       -ph height
              Set the height of the POSTSCRIPT image to height.

       -pl pos
              Set  the  leftmost position of the POSTSCRIPT image
              to pos.

       -pos   Print the relative starting position  of  the  data
              for the current resolution.

       -ppm   Write a ppm RGB (color) image.

       -ps    Write a RGB POSTSCRIPT color image.

       -psd   Write   a   Floyd-Steinberg   dithered   image   in
              POSTSCRIPT.

       -psg   Write a POSTSCRIPT grayscale image.

       -pw width
              Set the width of the POSTSCRIPT image to width.

       -r     Rotate the picture clockwise (portrait mode).

       -rep   Try to jump over  reading  errors  in  the  Huffman
              code.

       -S long short
              Cut  out  a subrectangle with boundaries defined by
              the values:

              long   For the longer side of the image.

              short  For the shorter side of the image.

              where long and short take one of two forms:

              a-b    Cut from position a to position b.

              a+b    Starting at offset a, cut a length of b.

              and where a and b are either integers  representing
              pixel  locations, or floating point values over the
              range [0.0 ... 1.0], representing the  fraction  of
              the length of a side.

       -s     Apply a simple sharpness operator to the luminosity
              channel.

       -vert  Flip the image vertically.

       -x     Overskip Mode (applicable to Base/16, Base/4,  Base
              and  4Base).   In  Photo-CD  images  the luminosity
              channel is stored in full resolution, the two chro­
              maticity  channels  are  stored  in half resolution
              only and have  to  be  interpolated.   In  Overskip
              Mode,  the chromaticity channels of the next higher
              resolution are taken instead of interpolating.   To
              see  the  difference, generate one ppm with and one
              ppm without this flag.  Use pnmarith(1L) to  gener­
              ate the difference image of these two images.  Call
              ppmhist(1L) for this difference  or  show  it  with
              xv(1L)  (push  the  HistEq button in the color edi­
              tor).

       -ycc   Write the image in ppm YCC format.

       -1|-Base/16|-128x192
              Extract the Base/16 image.

       -2 | -Base/4 | -256x384
              Extract the Base/4 image.

       -3 | -Base | -512x768
              Extract the Base image.

       -4 | -4Base | -1024x1536
              Extract the 4Base image.

       -5 | -16Base | -2048x3072
              Extract the 16Base image.

       -6 | -64Base | -4096x6144
              Extract the 64Base image. This  resolution  can  be
              extracted  from ProPhotoCD images only. The path of
              the 64Base extension files is derived from the path
              to  the image file. This means that it doesn't work
              on stdin an the directory  structure  must  be  the
              very same as on the ProPhotoCD.

POSTSCRIPT OUTPUT
       For  POSTSCRIPT  output  (options  -ps, -eps, -psg, -epsg,
       -psd, -epsg) you can define both the resolution and place­
       ment  of  the image.  Both size and position are specified
       in points (1/72 inch).

       The position of the image (where the origin is assumed  to
       be  at the lower left corner of the page) is controlled by
       the -pl and -pb options (applicable at all resolutions).

       The size of color and grayscale images is changed with the
       -pw and -ph options.  Every image pixel is mapped onto one
       POSTSCRIPT pixel.

       There are three modes of control for dithered POSTSCRIPT:

       Image size
              (-pw and -ph)

       Printer resolution
              (-dpi)

       Scaling factor
              (-fak)

       These three factors are interdependent, hence no more then
       two  can  be specified simultaneously.  Using -dpi and the
       -pw/-ph options together often  yields  pleasing  results.
       Even  using the default values for these options will pro­
       duce results differing from those obtained without use  of
       the options.

BUGS
       The program ignores read protection.

       The -i option is not working correctly.

       Available  information obout the Photo-CD format is vague;
       this program was developed by trial-and-error after  star­
       ing at hex-dumps.  Please send bugs reports and patches to
       the author.

VERSION
       The name hpcdtoppm stands for "Hadmut's pcdtoppm," to make
       it distinguishable in  the  event  that  someone  else  is
       building  a  similar  application  and naming it pcdtoppm.
       This is version 0.6.
