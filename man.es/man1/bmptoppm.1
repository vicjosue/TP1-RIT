NAME
       bmptoppm - convert a BMP file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       bmptoppm [bmpfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Microsoft Windows or OS/2 BMP file as input.  Pro­
       duces a portable pixmap as output.

       This program cannot convert BMP files with compressed (run
       length encoded) image data.  It recognizes the compression
       and issues an error message.

       This program cannot convert BMP files  with  16  bits  per
       pixel  (only  because  the  author did not have a complete
       specification for them).  It  recognizes  the  format  and
       issues an error message.
