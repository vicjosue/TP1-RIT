PDFOPT(1)               Ghostscript Tools               PDFOPT(1)



NAME
       pdfopt - Ghostscript PDF Optimizer

SYNOPSIS
       pdfopt [ options ] input.pdf output.pdf

DESCRIPTION
       pdfopt  uses  gs(1) to convert the Adobe Portable Document
       Format (PDF) file "input.pdf"  to  a  so-called  optimized
       form  in  "output.pdf".  Optimization puts the elements of
       the file into a more linear order and adds  "hint"  point­
       ers,  allowing  Adobe's  Acrobat(TM)  products  to display
       individual pages of the file more quickly  when  accessing
       the file through a network.

       Note:  input.pdf  and output.pdf must not be the same.  If
       they are, the file will  probably  be  destroyed.   pdfopt
       currently does not check for this.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documenta­
       tion on your system, from which you can get more  details.
