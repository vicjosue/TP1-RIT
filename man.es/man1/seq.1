NAME
       seq - print a sequence of numbers

SYNOPSIS
       seq [OPTION]... LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST

DESCRIPTION
       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       -f, --format FORMAT
              use printf(3) style FORMAT (default: %g)

       -s, --separator STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST  or  INCREMENT  is  omitted,  it  defaults to 1.
       FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST  are  interpreted  as  floating
       point  values.   INCREMENT  should be positive if FIRST is
       smaller than LAST, and negative  otherwise.   When  given,
       the  FORMAT  argument  must  contain  exactly  one  of the
       printf-style, floating point output formats %e, %f, %g
