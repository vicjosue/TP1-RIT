NNAAMMEE
       nseq - create or examine a netscape certificate sequence

       The nnsseeqq command takes a file containing a Netscape
       certificate sequence and prints out the certificates
       contained in it or takes a file of certificates and
       converts it into a Netscape certificate sequence.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --iinn ffiilleennaammee
           This specifies the input filename to read or standard
           input if this option is not specified.

       --oouutt ffiilleennaammee
           specifies the output filename or standard output by
           default.

       --ttoosseeqq
           normally a Netscape certificate sequence will be input
           and the output is the certificates contained in it.
           With the --ttoosseeqq option the situation is reversed: a
           Netscape certificate sequence is created from a file
           of certificates.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Output the certificates in a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in nseq.pem -out certs.pem

       Create a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in certs.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem


NNOOTTEESS
       The PPEEMM encoded form uses the same headers and footers as
       a certificate:

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       A Netscape certificate sequence is a Netscape specific
       form that can be sent to browsers as an alternative to the
       standard PKCS#7 format when several certificates are sent
       to the browser: for example during certificate enrollment.
       It is used by Netscape certificate server for example.

BBUUGGSS
       This program needs a few more options: like allowing DER
       or PEM input and output files and allowing multiple
       certificate files to be used.
