NAME
       lppasswd - add, change, or delete digest passwords.

SYNOPSIS
       lppasswd [ -a ] [ -g groupname ] [ -x ] [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
       lppasswd  adds,  changes, or deletes passwords in the CUPS
       digest password file, passwd.md5. When  run  by  a  normal
       user,  lppasswd will prompt for the old and new passwords.
       When run by the super-user, lppasswd can add new  accounts
       (-a  username),  change  existing  accounts (username), or
       delete accounts (-x username) in the digest password file.
       Digest  usernames  do  not  have to match local UNIX user­
       names, but only UNIX usernames are supported by  the  CUPS
       client programs (lp(1), lpr(1), etc.)

       The  -g  option  specifies  a  group other than the system
       group - "sys", "system", or "root", depending on the oper­
       ating system.

SECURITY ISSUES
       The  lppasswd  command  is installed setuid to root. While
       every attempt has been made  to  make  it  secure  against
       exploits   that  could  grant  super-user  priviledges  to
       unpriviledged users, paranoid  system  administrators  may
       wish  to disable or change the ownership of the program to
       an unpriviledged account.
