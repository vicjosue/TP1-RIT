NAME
       rgrep - a recursive, highlighting grep program

SYNOPSIS
       rgrep [ options ] pattern [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       rgrep,  unlike  grep(1) and egrep(1) rgrep has the ability
       to recursively descend directories. The traditional way of
       performing  this  kind  of search on Unix systems utilizes
       the find(1) command in conjunction with grep(1).  However,
       this results in very poor performance.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -?
              additional  help (use '-?' to avoid shell expansion
              on some systems)
       -c
              count matches
       -h
              highlight match (ANSI compatable terminal assumed)
       -H
              Output match  instead  of  entire  line  containing
              match
       -i
              ignore case
       -l
              list filename only
       -n
              print line number of match
       -F
              follow links
       -r
              recursively scan through directory tree
       -N
              Do NOT perform a recursive search
       -R 'pat'
              like  '-r'  except  that  only those files matching
              'pat' are checked
       -v
              print only lines that do NOT  match  the  specified
              pattern
       -x 'ext'
              checks only files with extension given by 'ext'.
       -D
              Print all directories that would be searched.  This
              option is for debugging purposes only.  No file  is
              grepped with this option.
       -W 'len'
              lines are 'len' characters long (not newline termi­
              nated).


SUPPORTED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS:
       .
              match any character except newline
       \d
              match any digit
       \e
              match ESC char
       *
              matches zero or more occurences of previous RE
       +
              matches one or more occurences of previous RE
       ?
              matches zero or one occurence of previous RE
       ^
              matches beginning of line
       $
              matches end of line
       [ ... ]
              matches any single character between brackets.  For
              example,  [-02468]  matches  '-' or any even digit.
              and [-0-9a-z] matches '-' and any digit  between  0
              and 9 as well as letters a through z.

       \{ ... \}

       \( ... \)

       \1, \2, ..., \9
              matches  match specified by nth '\( ... \)' expres­
              sion.   For  example,   '\([ \t][a-zA-Z]+\)\1[ \t]'
              matches any word repeated consecutively.


EXAMPLES
       Look  in  all files with a 'c' extension in current direc­
       tory and all its subdirectories  looking  for  matches  of
       'int  ' at the beginning of a line, printing the line con­
       taining the match with its line number: (two methods)

       rgrep -n -R '*.c' '^int ' .

       rgrep -n -x c '^int ' .

       Highlight  all  matches  of   repeated   words   in   file
       'paper.tex':

       rgrep -h '[ \t]\([a-zA-Z]+\)[ \t]+\1[ \t\n]' paper.tex

       rgrep -h '^\([a-zA-Z]+\)[ \t]+\1[ \t\n]' paper.tex

       (Note  that  this version of rgrep requires two passes for
       this example)

       Search through all files  EXCEPT  .o  and  .a  file  below
       /usr/src/linux  looking  for  the  string  'mouse' without
       regard to case:

       rgrep -i -R '*.[^ao]' mouse /usr/src/linux

       Search a fixed record length FITS  file  for  the  keyword
       EXTNAME:

       rgrep -W80 ^EXTNAME file.fits

       (Note  that the regular expression '^[A-Z]+' will dump all
       fits headers.)
