NAME
       groff - front end for the groff document formatting system

SYNOPSIS
       groff [ -abeghilpstvzCEGNRSUVXZ ] [ -wname ] [ -Wname ]
             [ -mname ] [ -Fdir ] [ -Idir ] [ -Tdev ] [ -ffam ]
             [ -Mdir ] [ -dcs ] [ -rcn ] [ -nnum ] [ -olist ]

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between a command line
       option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       groff is a front-end to the groff document formatting sys­
       tem.  Normally it runs the troff program and a postproces­
       sor  appropriate  for  the  selected  device.    Available
       devices are:

       ps     For PostScript printers and previewers

       dvi    For TeX dvi format.

       X75    For a 75dpi X11 previewer.

       X100   For a 100dpi X11 previewer.

       ascii  For typewriter-like devices.

       koi8-r For   typewriter-like  devices  using  the  Russian
              KOI8-R character set.

       latin1 For typewriter-like devices using the  ISO  Latin-1
              (ISO 8859-1) character set.

       utf8   For  typewriter-like devices using the Unicode (ISO
              10646) character set with UTF-8 encoding.

       cp1047 For typewriter-like devices which  use  the  EBCDIC
              code page IBM cp1047 (e.g. OS/390 Unix).

       lj4    For  an HP LaserJet4-compatible (or other PCL5-com­
              patible) printer.

       lbp    For Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4  and  LBP-8  series
              laser printers).

       html   To produce HTML output.

       The  postprocessor to be used for a device is specified by
       the postpro command in the device description file.   This
       can be overridden with the -X option.

       The  default  device  is ps.  It can optionally preprocess
       with any of pic, eqn, grn, grap, tbl, refer, or soelim.

       Options without an argument can be grouped behind a single
       -.  A filename of - denotes the standard input.

       The  grog  command  can be used to guess the correct groff
       command to use to format a file.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a help message.

       -e     Preprocess with eqn.

       -t     Preprocess with tbl.

       -g     Preprocess with grn.

       -G     Preprocess with grap.

       -p     Preprocess with pic.

       -s     Preprocess with soelim.

       -Idir  This option is as  described  in  soelim(1).   This
              option implies the -s option.

       -R     Preprocess  with  refer.   No mechanism is provided
              for passing arguments to refer because  most  refer
              options  have  equivalent  commands  which  can  be
              included  in  the  file.   See  refer(1)  for  more
              details.

       -v     Make  programs run by groff print out their version
              number.

       -V     Print the pipeline on stdout instead  of  executing
              it.

       -z     Suppress  output  from  troff.  Only error messages
              will be printed.

       -Z     Do not postprocess the output of  troff.   Normally
              groff  will automatically run the appropriate post­
              processor.

       -Parg  Pass  arg  to  the  postprocessor.   Each  argument
              should  be  passed with a separate -P option.  Note
              that groff does not prepend - to arg before passing
              it to the postprocessor.

       -l     Send  the  output  to  a spooler for printing.  The
              command used for this is  specified  by  the  print
              command in the device description file (if not pre­
              sent, -l has no effect).

       -Larg  Pass arg to the spooler.  Each argument  should  be
              passed  with a separate -L option.  Note that groff
              does not prepend - to arg before passing it to  the
              postprocessor.  If there is no print command in the
              device description file, -L is ignored.

       -Tdev  Prepare output for device dev.  The default  device
              is ps.

       -X     Preview  with  gxditview instead of using the usual
              postprocessor.  Groff passes gxditview a -printCom­
              mand  option  which  will  make the Print action do
              what groff would have done if  the  -l  option  had
              been  given.   This  is  unlikely  to  produce good
              results except with -Tps.

       -N     Don't allow newlines with eqn delimiters.  This  is
              the same as the -N option in eqn.

       -S     Safer  mode.  Pass the -S option to pic and disable
              the following troff requests: .open, .opena,  .pso,
              .sy,  and .pi.  For security reasons, safer mode is
              enabled by default.

       -U     Unsafe mode.  Reverts to the old unsafe  behaviour.

       -b

       -C
       -E
       -wname
       -Wname

       -rcn
       -Fdir
       -Mdir
       -ffam
       -nnum  These are as described in troff(1).

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX
              If  this  is  set  X,  then  groff  will run Xtroff
              instead of troff.  This also applies to  tbl,  pic,
              eqn,  grn, refer, and soelim.  It does not apply to
              grap, grops, grodvi, grotty, grolj4,  grohtml,  and
              gxditview.

       GROFF_TMAC_PATH
              A  colon  separated list of directories in which to
              search for macro files in addition to  the  default
              directories.  See troff(1) for more details.

       GROFF_TYPESETTER
              Default device.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A  colon  separated list of directories in which to
              search for the devname directory in addition to the
              default one.  See troff(1) for more details.

       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              This  search  path,  followed by PATH, will be used
              for  commands  executed  by  groff.   If  not  set,
              `/usr/bin' is prepended to PATH.

       GROFF_TMPDIR
              The directory in which temporary files will be cre­
              ated.  If this is not set and TMPDIR is set, tempo­
              rary files will be created in that directory.  Oth­
              erwise temporary files will  be  created  in  /tmp.
              The  grops(1) and refer(1) commands can create tem­
              porary files.

FILES
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devname/DESC
              Device description file for device name.

       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devname/F
              Font file for font F of device name.

       Note that on EBCDIC hosts, output devices  ascii,  koi8-r,
       latin1,  and  utf8 aren't available.  Similarly, cp1047 is
       not available on ASCII based operating systems.

EXAMPLE
       To print the man page foo.1 to the standard  output  using
       the  latin-1 output device and less as the pager, the fol­
       lowing command can be used:

              groff -mandoc -Tlatin1 foo.1 | less

       Alternatively, you can say

              groff -m mandoc -Tlatin1 foo.1 | less
