       head - output the first part of files

SYNOPSIS
       head [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  first  10  lines  of  each FILE to standard output.
       With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving
       the  file  name.   With  no  FILE, or when FILE is -, read
       standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to  long  options  are  mandatory  for
       short options too.

       -c, --bytes=SIZE
              print first SIZE bytes

       -n, --lines=NUMBER
              print first NUMBER lines instead of first 10

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never print headers giving file names

       -v, --verbose
              always print headers giving file names

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE  may have a multiplier suffix: b for 512, k for 1K, m
       for 1 Meg.  If -VALUE is used as  first  OPTION,  read  -c
       VALUE  when  one  of multipliers bkm follows concatenated,
       else read -n VALUE.
