       The lwp-download program will down load the document spec­
       ified by the URL given as the first command line argument
       to a local file.  The local filename used to save the doc­
       ument is guessed from the URL unless specified as the sec­
       ond command line argument.

       The lwp-download program is implemented using the libwww-
       perl library.  It is better suited to down load big files
       than the lwp-request program because it does not store the
       file in memory.  Another benefit is that it will keep you
       updated about its progress and that you don't have much
       options to worry about.

       Use the "-a" option to save the file in text (ascii) mode.
       Might make a difference on dosish systems.
