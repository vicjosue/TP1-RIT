NAME
       ical - An X based Calendar Program

SYNOPSIS
       Ical  provides  an X interface for maintaining a calendar.
       A calendar is basically just a set of items.  An  item  is
       either  an appointment, or a notice. An appointment starts
       at a particular time of the day, and finishes at a partic­
       ular  time of the day. A notice does not have any starting
       or ending time. Notices are  useful  for  marking  certain
       days  as  special.  For  example, a calendar may contain a
       notice for April 15th indicating that taxes are due.  When
       the documentation below refers to an item, it applies both
       to notices and appointments.  The main  features  of  ical
       are:
              * Items can be created and edited easily.
              * Items can be cut, copied and pasted.
              * Items can be made to repeat in various ways.
              *  Ical  will generate alarms for upcoming appoint­
                ments.
              * Users can view many calendars at a time.
              * Calendars can be shared by many users.
              * Related items can be grouped in their own  calen­
                dar.

INVOCATION

WINDOWS
       The  main  calendar  window  displays the appointments and
       notices for a particular date.

               Date Selector
                     The top left portion of the window  contains
                     a date selector.  You can click on the vari­
                     ous arrows to change the month or the  year.
                     The  day  of  the  month  can be selected by
                     clicking on the appropriate day in the month
                     display.  The date selector contains various
                     other buttons for convenient date selection.

               Notice Window
                     The  bottom  left portion of the window con­
                     tains the notices for the selected  date.  A
                     scroll bar is provided if all of the notices
                     for the selected date do not  fit  into  the
                     notice window.

               Appointment Window
                     The right portion of the window contains the
                     appointments for the selected day.  You  can
                     scroll  this region by using the scroll bar,
                     or by dragging with the middle mouse  button
                     in the background.

               Menubar
                     A menubar runs along the top of the calendar
                     window.  The File menu allows you to  create
                     and destroy application windows.

               Status Line
                     The  bottom portion of the window contains a
                     status line. This status line indicates  the
                     calendar  from which the selected item comes
                     and  whether  or  not  the   selected   item
                     repeats.

CALENDAR FILES
       A  calendar is stored in a calendar file. The default cal­
       endar file is named .calendar and is kept  in  the  user's
       home  directory.  If  the CALENDAR environment variable is
       set, its value is used as the name of the  calendar  file.
       The CALENDAR environment variable and the default can both
       be overridden by specifying a file  name  on  the  command
       line as follows -- ical -calendar file-name.  Ical period­
       ically saves any modifications made to a calendar  to  the
       corresponding calendar file. It also periodically incorpo­
       rates changes made to a  shared  calendar  file  by  other
       instances of ical.  You can explicitly trigger these peri­
       odic saves and reads by using the File menu.

   Including and Sharing Calendars
       You can include other calendars into your  private  calen­
       dar.  This  facility is mainly useful for allowing a group
       of people to share a common set  of  items.  For  example,
       members  of  a particular group might have a calendar that
       contains the birthdays for each member of the group.  This
       calendar  can  be  included in each group member's private
       calendar.  Use the File menu to include and exclude shared
       calendars.   Use  the Move Item To ... entry from the Item
       menu to move items between calendars.  Use the From Calen­
       dar ... entry in the List menu to list all items a partic­
       ular calendar.

ITEMS
   Notices
       You can enter notices by clicking in the background in the
       bottom-left  portion  of  the  main  calendar window. This
       click will create a new notice for the selected date.  You
       can  enter text into the notice by typing into it while it
       is selected (selected notices  are  highlighted  by  being
       displayed  in different colors).  A notice can be selected
       for editing by clicking with left button.

   Appointments
       You can enter appointments by left-clicking in  the  back­
       ground  in  the right portion of the main calendar window.
       This click will create a new appointment for the  selected
       date. The start time for this appointment is determined by
       the click location. You can move the appointment by  drag­
       ging  it  with  the  middle  mouse  button  held down. The
       appointment can be resized  by  dragging  with  the  right
       mouse button held down.

       Appointment text can be edited by typing into the appoint­
       ment window while it is selected.  If the appointment text
       you  are typing in does not fit into the appointment area,
       then it will overflow out of  the  appointment  area,  but
       will be editable normally.  If you do not like overflowing
       text, you should turn off the Allow Text  Overflow  option
       in the Options menu .  With this option turned off, if the
       current text completely fills the area  allocated  to  the
       appointment,  then  any attempts to add to the appointment
       text will be ignored until  the  appointment  is  enlarged
       with  the  right  mouse button.  Likewise, the right mouse
       button will refuse to shrink an appointment window if  the
       appointment  text completely fills the appointment window.

   Alarms
       Ical generates alarms for appointments.  By  default,  the
       first  alarm  is  generated  fifteen  minutes  before  the
       appointment is supposed to start and successive alarms are
       generated  every  five minutes until the appointment actu­
       ally starts.  You can  change  this  default  behavior  by
       selecting  the Default Alarms entry from the Options menu.
       You can also change the timings  of  these  alarms  on  an
       appointment-by-appointment basis by double-clicking on the
       appointment, or by  selecting  the  appointment  and  then
       chosing the Properties entry in the Item menu.

   Repeating Items
       Items  can be made to repeat in various ways. Item repeti­
       tion can be controlled by using the entries in the  Repeat
       menu.   These entries make the item repeat in certain fre­
       quently used ways. For example, the  Monthly  entry  makes
       the  selected  item  repeat  once per month and the Weekly
       entry makes the selected item repeat once per  week.   The
       Edit  Monthly... and Edit Weekly... entries can be used to
       make items that repeat in more complex ways: for  example,
       an  item  that occurs on the last Friday of each month, or
       an item that occurs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every
       week.

       In  addition  to  making an item repeat in one of the pre-
       defined ways, you can also restrict an item's starting and
       finishing  date  by  selecting the Set Range... entry from
       the Repeat menu.

       Normally, a modification to a repeating  item  applies  to
       all  occurrences  of  that  item. A single occurrence of a
       repeating item can be modified by selecting the occurrence
       and  then  choosing  the Make Unique entry from the Repeat
       menu.  The selected occurrence can now be  modified  inde­
       pendently of the repeating item.

   Todo Items
       Items  can  be  marked as todo items by selecting the Todo
       entry in the Item menu.   A  todo  item  is  automatically
       moved  forward to today's date every day until the item is
       deleted or marked as done.  An item can be marked as  done
       by clicking in the little check-box right next to the dis­
       played item.

   Highlighting
       By default, if any item occurs on a date, then the date is
       highlighted  in  the date selector located in the top-left
       corner of the calendar window.  You can use the  Highlight
       entries  in  the  Item  menu  to control this highlighting
       behavior on an item-by-item basis.

KEY BINDINGS
       This section is currently incomplete.

EDITING
       Dragging with the left mouse button in a selected appoint­
       ment  or  notice sets the X selection.  The Edit menu pro­
       vides commands for dealing with the X selection.

       Ical also has a clipboard that can store  a  single  item.
       The  Copy  entry in the Edit menu copies the selected item
       into the clipboard.  The Cut entry does the same,  but  it
       also  deletes  the item from the calendar. If the selected
       item repeats, then the Cut  command  allows  the  user  to
       delete  all  occurrences of the item, or just the selected
       occurrence.  However, if the selected item does not belong
       to you, then Cut just hides the item from you.  Other peo­
       ple will still see the item.  An item in the clipboard can
       be inserted into the current day by selecting Paste entry.
       The newly pasted item loses  all  repetition  information,
       and occurs just on the day in which it was pasted.

LISTING ITEMS
       You  can  generate listings of imminent items by selecting
       one of the listing options in the List menu.  You can also
       use  the  command  line options -list, -show, or -popup to
       generate item listings.  The command line options are most
       useful in .login files.

       By default an item is included in a listing for a particu­
       lar date if it occurs either on that date, or on the  very
       next  day.   You can control this feature of item listings
       with the List item entry in the Item menu.

PRINTING
       Calendar contents can be printed by  selecting  the  Print
       option from the File menu.

CUSTOMIZATION
       Some  of ical's behavior can be customized via the Options
       menu.  Other aspects of ical's behavior can be  controlled
       via X Resources.

   X Resources
   Behavior
       The  following  X resources can be used to control various
       aspects of ical's behavior.

               Ical.pollSeconds
                     Shared calendars  are  checked  for  changes
                     made  by other people once every pollSeconds
                     seconds.  The default value is 120.  If ical
                     appears sluggish, or if it is using too much
                     CPU time, increase this value.

               Ical.saveSeconds
                     Calendar files are saved once every saveSec­
                     onds  seconds.  The default value is 30.  If
                     ical appears sluggish, or if it is using too
                     much CPU time, increase this value.

   Dimensions
       The  following  X resources can be used to control various
       dimensions of ical's appearance.

               Ical.itemSelectWidth
                     The border width of selected items is set to
                     the  value  of  this  option  to display the
                     selected status of the item to to the  user.
                     On color displays, the default value of this
                     option is 1 because on color displays selec­
                     tion  is  indicated by changing the color of
                     the selected item.  On monochrome  displays,
                     the default value of itemSelectWidth is 4.

               Ical.Dayview.geometry
                     X  geometry  specification for main calendar
                     window.  Usually, you will just specify  the
                     window  position here.  The size of the win­
                     dow is easier to  control  via  the  Options
                     menu.

               Ical.Reminder.geometry
                     X  geometry  specification for alarms.  Usu­
                     ally, you will just specify the window posi­
                     tion  here.   The window size will be calcu­
                     lated automatically.

               Ical.Listing.geometry
                     X geometry specification for item  listings.
                     Usually,  you  will  just specify the window
                     position here.  The window size will be cal­
                     culated automatically.

   Colors
       The  following X resources can be used to customize ical's
       use of colors.  If ical windows  show  up  with  illegible
       colors  (not  enough  distinction  between  background and
       foreground), it may be because your  X  resources  contain
       definitions  for  *foreground or *background that conflict
       with ical colors.  In general, it is a bad idea to  define
       *foreground  and  *background in your resources because it
       will break a number of programs.  You will be  better  off
       defining resources on an application by application basis.

               Ical*Foreground/Ical*Background
                     Foreground and background colors for most of
                     ical's windows.

               Ical*disabledForeground
                     Foreground  color  assigned to disabled but­
                     tons and menu entries.

               Ical.itemFg/Ical.itemBg
                     Foreground and background colors  for  unse­
                     lected  items.   The  default  foreground is
                     black and the default background is gray.

               Ical.itemSelectFg/Ical.itemSelectBg
                     Foreground   and   background   colors   for
                     selected  items.   The default foreground is
                     black and the default background  is  Slate­
                     Blue1.

               Ical.itemOverflowColor/Ical.itemOverflowStipple
                     Background  color  and  stippling  used  for
                     appointment text that overflows out  of  the
                     appointment  area.   On  color displays, the
                     default overflow  background  is  SlateBlue3
                     and  no  stippling  is done (specified by an
                     empty stipple option).  On  monochrome  dis­
                     plays,  the  default  overflow background is
                     black, and the default overflow stippling is
                     gray50.

               Ical.apptLineColor
                     The color for the background lines and times
                     displayed in the appointment window.

               Ical.weekdayColor
                     The color used to display days of the  week.
                     The default is black.

               Ical.weekendColor
                     The  color  used  to  display weekends.  The
                     default is red.

               Ical.interestColor
                     The  color  used  to  highlight  interesting
                     dates.  The default is blue.

               Ical.weekendInterestColor
                     The  color  used  to  highlight  interesting
                     dates on weekends and holidays.  The default
                     is purple.

   Fonts
       The  following  resources  can be used to customize ical's
       use of fonts.

               Ical.fontFamily
                     Preferred font family.   Fonts  for  various
                     purposes   are  obtained  from  this  family
                     unless overridden with one of the specifica­
                     tions  below.   The  default  font family is
                     times.  Some other  font  families  you  can
                     specify   here   are  charter,  new  century
                     schoolbook,  and  helvetica.   My   personal
                     favorite is new century schoolbook.

               Ical.fixedFontFamily
                     Preferred font family for fixed-width fonts.
                     Fixed-width fonts for various  purposes  are
                     obtained  from this family unless overridden
                     with one of the specifications  below.   The
                     default  font family is courier.  Some other
                     font families you can specify here are fixed
                     and terminal.

               Ical.fontSize
                     Font  sizes  used  for  ical.  Use the value
                     small to use small  font  sizes  everywhere.
                     Any  other value for this option defaults to
                     the normal fonts.

               Ical*itemFont
                     Font used to display item contents.

               Ical.weekdayFont
                     Font used for displaying days of the week.

               Ical.weekendFont
                     Font used for displaying weekends.

               Ical.interestFont
                     Font used to highlight interesting dates.

               Ical.weekendInterestFont
                     Font used to highlight interesting dates  on
                     weekends and holidays.

               Ical.smallHeadingFont
                     Font used for small headings.

               Ical.largeHeadingFont
                     Font used for large headings.

               Ical*<class>*font:
                     Font  used  for  windows of a certain class.
                     Possible  values  for  <class>  are  Dialog,
                     Button,  Label,  Menubutton,  Menu, Listbox,
                     and Reminder.

   Tcl Code
       Users can also customize ical  by  writing  tcl  code  and
       storing  it  in  the  file  ~/.tk/ical/user.tcl.  The code
       stored in this file is executed when ical starts up.

       Ical  also  looks  for  site-specific  customizations   at
       startup.   These  customizations can be placed in the file
       site.tcl in either the ical library directory, or its par­
       ent  directory.   (By  default, ical looks for site.tcl in
       /usr/local/lib/ical/v[version]/, and /usr/local/lib/ical/,
       but  these  directories  may  be located elsewhere on your
       system.)  The site specific files will be loaded in before
       any user specific customization file is loaded in.

       See the "Tcl Interface to Ical" document available via the
       Ical help menu.

       Ical can run even when X is not available, therefore  cus­
       tomization files should be written so that they will func­
       tion even when Tk commands are not available.

                     this new item are parsed from the  X  selec­
                     tion if possible.

   Item Menu
               Todo  Toggle  the  item  between being a todo item
                     and not being a todo item.

               Always Highlight
                     The item  always  causes  the  corresponding
                     date to be highlighted.  This is the default
                     behavior.

               Never Highlight
                     The item never causes the corresponding date
                     to be highlighted.

               Highlight Future
                     The item causes the corresponding date to be
                     highlighted if and only if the date  is  not
                     in the past.

               Holiday
                     The item causes the corresponding date to be
                     highlighted as a holiday.

               Change Alarms
                     This item pops up a dialog box  that  allows
                     you  to edit the alarm times for an appoint­
                     ment.

              Note that this will only change the alarm times for
              the  selected  appointments.   You  can  make  this
              change for all appointments that do not  have  spe­
              cial  alarm times by using the Default Alarms entry
              in the Options menu.

               Early Warning
                     By default an item is included in a  listing
                     for a particular date if it occurs either on
                     that date, or on the very next  day.   Some­
                     times,  you  may  want to include an item in
                     listings for earlier dates. For example,  if
                     you have an item reminding you of a birthday
                     on March 17th, you might want this  item  to
                     be  included  in all listings from March 7th
                     to March 17th so that you will  have  enough
                     time  to  go out and buy a present.  You can
                     achieve this effect by selecting  this  menu
                     entry  and  then entering "10 days" into the
                     resulting dialog.

              Note that this will only change the listing  behav­
              ior  for  the  selected  item.   You  can make this
              change for all items you  create  from  now  on  by
              using  the  Default  Listings  entry in the Options
              menu.

               Properties ...
                     Edit various item properties, including  the
                     calendar  to  which  the item belongs, high­
                     lighting information, early warning options,
                     alarm  times,  and starting and ending times
                     for appointments.  You can also double-click
                     on  an  item  to pop up the property editing
                     dialog.

               Search Forward
                     Search forward looking for an item that con­
                     tains a user specified string.

               Search Backward
                     Search  backward  looking  for  an item that
                     contains a user specified string.

   Repeat Menu
               Don't Repeat
                     Make the selected item a non-repeating item.

               Daily Make the item repeat every day.

               Weekly
                     Make the item repeat once every week.

               Monthly
                     Make the item repeat once every month.

               Annually
                     Make the item repeat once every year.

               Edit Weekly
                     Make  the item repeat on a weekly basis in a
                     complicated fashion.  For example, on  Tues­
                     day and Thursday every week.

               Edit Monthly
                     Make the item repeat on a monthly basis in a
                     complicated fashion.  For  example,  on  the
                     third  Sunday  in  June, or the last working
                     day of each month.

               Set Range...
                     Restrict the range for a repeating item.

               Last Occurrence
                     Make the current occurrence the last  occur­
                     rence  of  the  selected item.  I.e., remove
                     any occurrences after the current date.

               Make Unique
                     If you want to modify just a  single  occur­
                     rence  of  a repeating item, select the item
                     occurrence  you  want  to  modify  and  then
                     activate this menu entry.  Now all modifica­
                     tions to  this  item  occurrence  will  only
                     affect this particular occurrence.

   List Menu

                     calendar.

   Option Menu
               Appointment Range
                     Controls  the  subset  of a day displayed by
                     default in  the  appointment  listing.   The
                     factory settings display 8:00am to 6:00pm.

               Notice Window Height
                     This  entry can be used to change the height
                     of the notice window.

               Item Width
                     This entry can be used to change  the  width
                     of displayed appointments and notices.

               Allow Text Overflow
                     If  this  option  is  selected, then you can
                     type in any amount of text into an  appoint­
                     ment.   The  part  of the text that does not
                     fit into the appointment will be allowed  to
                     overflow  out of the appointment.  If you do
                     not like text overflowing out of an appoint­
                     ment,  then you should turn off this option.

               Display Am/Pm
                     If this option is  selected,  time  will  be
                     printed  in  twelve  hour mode with am or pm
                     indicators.  Otherwise, time will be printed
                     in twenty-four hour mode.

               Start Week on Monday
                     If  this  option is selected, month displays
                     will start each week off on a Monday.   Oth­
                     erwise, each week will start on a Sunday.

               Default Alarms
                     Use  this  menu  entry  to  change  the time
                     intervals at which alarms go off.  The  fac­
                     tory  settings  cause alarms to be triggered
                     fifteen minutes before each appointment, and
                     then  once  every  five  minutes  until  the
                     appointment  actually  starts.   This   menu
                     entry changes the default alarm behavior for
                     all appointments.   You  can  override  this
                     default   behavior   on  an  appointment-by-
                     appointment basis by selecting  an  appoint­
                     ment  and  then  selecting the Change Alarms
                     entry in the item menu.

               Default Listings
                     This menu can be used to select the  default
                     listing  behavior  for  newly created items.
                     If the On Occurrence entry is selected, then
                     a  newly  created item will only be shown in
                     the listing of the day  on  which  the  item
                     occurs.    If  the  A  Day  Early  entry  is
                     selected, then a new item will be  shown  in
                     listings  starting  a  day  before  the item
                     occurrence.   Similarly,  the   other   menu
                     entries  can  be  selected to make new items
                     show up in listings a number of days  before
                     their  actual occurrence.  This menu selects
                     the default behavior for new  items.   Indi­
                     vidual  item  behavior  can be controlled by
                     similar entries in the Item menu.
