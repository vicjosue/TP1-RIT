NAME
       winicontoppm  - convert a Windows .ico file into 1 or more
       portable pixmap files

SYNOPSIS
       winicontoppm  [-writeands]  [-allicons|-bestqual]   [-mul­
       tippm] [-verbose] [iconfile] [ppmdestfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Microsoft Windows .ico file, converts it to one or
       more ppms.

       A Windows icon contains 1 or  more  images,  at  different
       resolutions  and  color  depths.   Each image has an 'and'
       mask, which contains transparancy data.

       By default, the output goes to Standard  Output.   If  you
       specify  ppmdestfile,  output  goes into one or more files
       named as follows.  If it's just one file (i.e. you specify
       the -multippm option or don't specify -allicons), the file
       specification is ppmdestfile.ppm.  If it's multiple files,
       their  file specifications are ppmdestfile_1.ppm, ppmdest­
       file_2.ppm, etc.

       When you specify  the  -writeands  option,  the  filenames
       above  are  modified  to  include  the  string  xor  as in
       ppmdestfile_xor.ppm or ppmdestfile_xor_1.ppm.


OPTIONS
       -writeands
              For  each  icon  written,  also  write  the   'and'
              (transparancy)  mask  as a seperate PBM file.  It's
              name is of the form ppmdestfile_and.pbm or ppmdest­
              file_and_1.pbm.

       -allicons
              Extract all images from the .ico file.

       -bestqual
              Extract  only the best quality (largest, then high­
              est bpp) image from the .ico file.

       -multippm
              Write all ppms to a single file.
