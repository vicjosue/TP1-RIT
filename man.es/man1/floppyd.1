floppyd(1)                                             floppyd(1)



Name
       floppyd  - floppy daemon for remote access to floppy drive
       floppyd_installtest - tests whether floppyd  is  installed
       and running



Note of warning
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.


Description
       Floppyd is used as a server to grant access to the  floppy
       drive to clients running on a remote machine, just as an X
       server grants access to the display to remote clients.  It
       has the following syntax:

       floppyd  [-d] [-l] [-s port] [-r user] [-b ipaddr] device­
       name [displaynames]

       floppyd is always associated with an X server.  It runs on
       the same machine as its X server, and listens on port 5703
       and above.


Authentication
       floppyd authenticates remote clients using the  Xauthority
       protocol.  Xhost  authentication  is  not  supported. Each
       floppyd is associated with an X  server.   When  a  remote
       client  attempts  to  connect to floppyd, it sends floppyd
       the  X  authority  record  corresponding  to  floppyd's  X
       server.   Floppyd  in turn then tries to open up a connec­
       tion to the X server in order to verify  the  authenticity
       of  the  xauth  record.  If the connection to the X server
       succeeds, the client is granted access

       Caution: In order to make authentication  work  correctly,
       the  local  host should not be listed in the xhost list of
       allowed hosts.
        Indeed, hosts listed in xhost do not need a correct  Xau­
       thority cookie to connect to the X server. As floppyd runs
       on the same host as the X server, all its probe connection
       would  succeed even for clients who supplied a bad cookie.
       This means that your floppy drive would  be  open  to  the
       world, i.e. a huge security hole.
        If your X server does not allow you to remove localhost:0
       and :0 from the xhost list, you can prevent  floppyd  from
       probing those display names with the -l option.


Command line options
       d      Daemon  mode. Floppyd runs its own server loop.  Do
              not  supply  this  if  you   start   floppyd   from
              inetd.conf

       s  port
              Port  number  for  deamon  mode.  Default is 5703 +
              displaynumber.  This flag implies daemon mode.  For
              example,  for  display hitchhiker:5, the port would
              be 5708.

       b  ipaddr
              Bind address  (for  multihomed  hosts).  This  flag
              implies daemon mode

       r user
              Run the server under as the given user

       l      Do not generate local default display names

       devicename  is  the  name of the device node to be opened.
       Default is /dev/fd0.

       displaynames is a list of display names to connect to  for
       authentication.   All displays in the list are tried until
       one is found that grants  access  or  until  the  list  is
       exhausted.   If  no  list  is supplied, the a display name
       list based on the ip address supplied using the -b flag is
       constructed: ipaddr:n.0.

       *  :n.0
               If  floppyd  is started from inetd, the address of
              the socket  used  for  stdin  is  used  as  a  bind
              address.

        If  no  bind  address  is supplied, a list containing the
       following 3 items is constructed:

       *  hostname:n.0

       *  localhost:n.0

       *  :n.0

        n is the display number  derived  from  the  port  number
       (port  - 5703 modulo 10). The local items (localhost:0 and
       :0) are not constructed if the -l flag is given.


Connecting to floppyd
        In order to use floppyd,  add  the  flag  remote  to  the
       device  description  in  your  `~/.mtoolsrc' file.  If the
       flag remote is given, the file  parameter  of  the  device
       description  is taken to be a remote address.  It's format
       is the following: hostname:displaynumber[/baseport].  When
       using  this  entry,  mtools connects to port baseport+dis­
       playnumber at hostname. By default baseport is 5703.


Examples:
        The following starts a floppy  daemon  giving  access  to
       `/dev/fd0',  listening  on  the default port 5703, tied to
       the default X servers:


          floppyd -d /dev/fd0



        Each of the  following  starts  a  floppy  daemon  giving
       access  to `/dev/fd1', tied to the :1 local X servers, and
       listening on port 5704. We assume that the local  host  is
       named hitchhiker.


          floppyd -d /dev/fd0 localhost:1 hitchhiker:1 :1
          floppyd -p 5704 /dev/fd0



        If  you want to start floppyd by inetd instead of running
       it as a daemon, insert the following lines into `/etc/ser­
       vices':

          # floppy daemon
          floppyd-0    5703/tcp    # floppy daemon for X server :0
          floppyd-1    5704/tcp    # floppy daemon for X server :1



        And insert the following into `/etc/inetd.conf' (assuming
       that  you  have  defined  a  user  named  floppy  in  your
       `/etc/passwd'):


          # floppy daemon
          floppyd-0   stream  tcp  wait  floppy  /usr/sbin/floppyd floppyd /dev/fd0
          floppyd-1   stream  tcp  wait  floppy  /usr/sbin/floppyd floppyd /dev/fd1



        Note  that you need to supply the X display names for the
       second floppyd.  This is because the  port  is  opened  by
       inetd.conf,  and  hence  floppyd cannot know its number to
       interfere the display number.

        On the  client  side,  insert  the  following  into  your
       `~/.mtoolsrc'  to  define  a drive letter accessing floppy
       drive in your X terminal:

          drive x: file="$DISPLAY" remote

Viewing the texi doc
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To  generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc,
              run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

              A    premade    html    can    be     found     at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'      and      also     at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To generate an info copy  (browsable  using  emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
