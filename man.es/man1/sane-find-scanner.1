NAME
       sane-find-scanner  -  find SCSI and USB scanners and their
       device files

SYNOPSIS
       sane-find-scanner [-h|-?]  [-v] [devname]

DESCRIPTION
       sane-find-scanner is a command-line tool to find SCSI  and
       some  USB  scanners and determine their Unix device files.
       It's part of the  sane-backends  package.  It  checks  the
       default  generic SCSI devices, e.g. /dev/sg? for Linux and
       the their USB  pendants  (e.g.  /dev/usb/scanner0).   Also
       /dev/scanner and /dev/usb/scanner are checked. The test is
       done by sending a SCSI inquiry command and looking  for  a
       device type of "scanner" or "processor" (some old HP scan­
       ners seem to send "processor"). So sane-find-scanner  will
       find  any  SCSI  scanner even if it isn't supported by any
       SANE backend. For USB devices, the corresponding files are
       opened and the vendor and device ids are determined if the
       operating system  supports  this  feature.  Currently  USB
       scanners are only found if they are supported by the Linux
       scanner module or the FreeBSD uscanner driver.  sane-find-
       scanner  won't  find  parallel  port scanners, or scanners
       connected to proprietary ports.


OPTIONS
       -h, -?  Prints a short usage message.

       -v      Verbose output. Show every  device  name  and  the
               test result.

       devname Test  device  file "devname". No other devices are
               checked if devname is given.

EXAMPLE
       sane-find-scanner -v
       Check all SCSI and USB devices for available scanners  and
       print a line for every device file.

       sane-find-scanner /dev/scanner
       Look  for  a  scanner (only) at /dev/scanner and print the
       result.

BUGS
       No support for parallel port  scanners  yet.  USB  support
       should be extended to other platforms and scanners. Detec­
       tion of USB vendor/device ids should be extended, if  pos­
       sible.
