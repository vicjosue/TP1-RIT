OSGMLNORM(1)                osgmlnorm                OSGMLNORM(1)



NAME
       osgmlnorm  -  An  SGML  System Conforming to International
       Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       osgmlnorm [-Cdemnv] [-bbctf] [-ccatalog] [-Ddir...]
                 [-iname...] [-wwarning...] [sysid...]



DESCRIPTION
       osgmlnorm prints on the standard output a normalized docu­
       ment  instance for the SGML document contained in the con­
       catenation  of  the  entities  with   system   identifiers
       [sysid...].


       When the normalized instance is prefixed with the original
       SGML declaration and prolog, it will have the same ESIS as
       the original SGML document, with the following exceptions:


       * The output of osgmlnorm does  not  protect  against  the
       recognition  of  short reference delimiters, so any USEMAP
       declarations must be removed from the DTD.


       * The normalized instance will use  the  reference  delim­
       iters, even if the original instance did not.


       *  If marked sections are included in the output using the
       -m option, the reference reserved names will be  used  for
       the status keywords even if the original instance did not.


       * Any ESIS information relating to the SGML  LINK  feature
       will be lost.


       The  normalized instance will not use any markup minimiza­
       tion features except that:


       * Any attributes that were not specified in  the  original
       instance  will not be included in the normalized instance.
       (Current attributes will be included.)


       * If the declared value of an attribute was a  name  token
       group,  and a value was specified that was the same as the
       name of the attribute, then the attribute name  and  value
       indicator  will  be omitted. For example, with HTML osgml­
       norm would  output  <DL  COMPACT>  rather  than  <DL  COM­
       PACT="COMPACT">


       The following options are available:


       -bbctf Use the BCTF with name bctf for output.


       -cfile Use the catalog entry file file.


       -C     This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -d     Output  a  document  type declaration with the same
              external identifier as the input document, and with
              no  internal  declaration  subset. No check is per­
              formed that the document  instance  is  valid  with
              respect to this DTD.


       -Ddirectory
              Search  directory  for  files  specified  in system
              identifiers.

              This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.


       -iname This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).


       -m     Output any marked sections that were in  the  input
              document instance.


       -n     Output any comments that were in the input document
              instance.


       -r     Raw output. Don't perform any conversion on RSs and
              REs when printing the entity. The entity would typ­
              ically   have   the   storage   manager   attribute
              records=asis.


       -v     Print the version number.


       -wtype Control warnings and errors according to type. This
              has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).
