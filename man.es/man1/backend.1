NAME
       backend - cups backend transmission interfaces

SYNOPSIS
       backend job user title num-copies options [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  CUPS backend interface provides a standard method for
       sending document files to different physical interfaces.

       Backends must be capable of reading from a filename on the
       command-line or from the standard input, copying the stan­
       dard input to a temporary file if required by the physical
       interface.

       The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of the
       destination printer.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables  are  defined  by  the
       CUPS server when executing the backend:

       CHARSET
            The default text character set (typically us-ascii or
            iso-8859-1).

       CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME type associated with the file (e.g. applica­
            tion/postscript).

       CUPS_DATADIR
            The directory where data files can be found.

       CUPS_SERVERROOT
            The root directory of the server.

       DEVICE_URI
            The  device-uri  associated with the printer; this is
            provided for shell scripts which may not be  able  to
            get the passed argv[0] string.

       LANG
            The default language locale (typically C or en).

       PATH
            The  standard  execution  path  for external programs
            that may be run by the backend.

            tion (PPD) file for this printer.

            Image Processors (RIPs).

       SOFTWARE
            The name and version number of the server  (typically
            CUPS/1.1).
