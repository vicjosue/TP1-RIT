DESCRIPTION
       The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is used
       to  edit  and  manipulate  images.  It can load and save a
       variety of image  formats  and  can  be  used  to  convert
       between formats.

       Gimp  can  also  be used as a paint program. It features a
       set of drawing and painting tools such as airbrush, clone,
       pencil, and paint brush. Painting and drawing tools can be
       applied to an image with a variety  of  paint  modes.   It
       also  offers  an  extensive  array of selection tools like
       rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,  intelli­
       gent scissors, and select by color.

       Gimp offers a variety of plugins that perform a variety of
       image  manipulations.   Examples  include  bumpmap,   edge
       detect, gaussian blur, and many others.

       In  addition,  Gimp  has several scripting extension which
       allow for advanced non-interactive processing and creation
       of images.

OPTIONS
       The gimp accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
               Display a list of all commandline options.

       -v, --version
               Output the version info.

       -b, --batch <commands>
               Execute  the  set of <commands> non-interactively.
               The set of <commands> is typically in the form  of
               a  script  that can be executed by one of the Gimp
               scripting extensions.

       -g, --gimprc <gimprc>
               Use an alternative gimprc instead of  the  default
               one.  Useful  in  cases  where  plugins  paths  or
               machine specs may be different.

       -i, --no-interface
               Run without a user interface.

       -r, --restore-session
               Try to restore saved session.

       -d, --no-data
               Do not  load  patterns,  gradients,  palettes,  or
               brushes.  Often  useful  in non-interactive situa­
               tions where startup time is to be minimized.

       --verbose
               Show startup messages.

       --no-shm
               Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its plu­
               gins.   Instead  of using shared memory, GIMP will
               send the data via pipe. This will result in slower
               performance than using shared memory.

       --no-xshm
               Do  not use the X Shared Memory extension. If GIMP
               is being displayed on  a  remote  X  server,  this
               probably  needs to be enabled. Also useful for any
               X server  that  doesn't  properly  support  the  X
               shared  memory  extension.   This  will  result in
               slower  performance  than  with  X  shared  memory
               enabled.

       --display display
               Use the designated X display.

       -s, --no-splash
               Do not show the splash screen.

       -S, --no-splash-image
               Do not show the splash screen image as part of the
               splash screen.

       --debug-handlers
               Enable debugging signal handlers.

       -c, --console-messages
               Do not popup dialog boxes on errors  or  warnings.
               Print the messages on the console instead.

       --enable-stack-trace {never|query|always}
               If  a  stack-trace  should be generated in case of
               fatal signals.

       --system-gimprc <gimprc>
               Use an alternate system gimprc file.


ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that  overrides
               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN­
               AGER property.

FILES
       Gimp's data files are stored in  ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2,
       where  ${prefix}  is  set  on  install,  but  is typically
       /usr/local. Gimp's  system-wide  configuration  files  are
       stored  in /etc/gimp/1.2.  Most gimp configuration is read
       in from the user's init file, $HOME/.gimp-1.2/gimprc.  The
       system  wide equivalent is in /etc/gimprc. The system wide
       file is parsed first and the user gimprc can override  the
       system  settings.   /etc/gimprc_user is the default gimprc
       placed in users' home directories the first time  gimp  is
       run.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/gtkrc  -  users  set  of gimp-specific GTK
       config settings. Options such as widget  color  and  fonts
       sizes can be set here.

       /etc/gimp/1.2/gtkrc  - sytem wide default set of gimp-spe­
       cific GTK config settings.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/ideas - lists all images  that  have  been
       opened or saved using Gimp.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/menurc - user's set of keybindings.

       /etc/gimp/1.2/menurc - system wide set of keybindings.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/parasiterc  - Description of all available
       gimp parasites. This is file is recreated  everytime  gimp
       starts up.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/sessionrc  -  This file takes session-spe­
       cific info (that is info, you want  to  keep  between  two
       gimp-sessions).  You are not supposed to edit it manually,
       but of course you can  do.  This  file  will  be  entirely
       rewritten every time you quit the gimp. If this file isn't
       found, defaults are used.

       /etc/gimp/1.2/unitrc - default user unit database. It con­
       tains  the unit definitions for centimeters, meters, feet,
       yards, typographic points and  typographic  picas  and  is
       placed  in  users home directories the first time the gimp
       is ran.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/unitrc - This file contains your user unit
       database.  You  can modify this list with the unit editor.
       You are not supposed to edit it manually,  but  of  course
       you  can  do.   This file will be entirely rewritten every
       time you quit the gimp.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins - location of user installed plu­
       gins.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/pluginrc  -  plugin  initialization values
       are stored here. This file is parsed on startup and regen­
       erated if need be.

       ules.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/tmp - default location that gimp  uses  as
       temporary space.

       ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2/brushes   -   system  wide  brush
       files.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/brushes - user created and installed brush
       files. These files are in the .gbr (gimp brush) format.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/generated_brushes  - Brushes generated and
       saved from the brush dialog. These files are in  the  .vbr
       (gimp vector brush) format.

       saved from the Levels tool.

       ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2/palettes  -   the   system   wide

       directory when gimp is first ran to allow the user to mod­
       ify  the  palettes.  This  directory  is  not searched for
       palettes by default.

       $HOME/.gimp-1.2/palettes - copies of  the  system  palette

SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
       Any bugs found should be reported to  the  Gimp  Developer
       mailing list at gimp-developer@xcf.berkeley.edu or you may
       want to make use of the online bug-tracking system  avail­
       able  on the web at http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html
       or   submit   a   bug   report   to   the    system    via
       http://www.xach.com/gimp/news/bugreport.html

       Before  reporting  bugs, please check to see if the bug is
       mentioned in the FAQ's or the mailing  list  archive.  See
       the section on Other Info for locations of these.

       When  reporting  Gimp  bugs,  it is important to include a
       reliable way to reproduce the bug, version number of  Gimp
       (and  probably GTK), OS name and version, and any relevant
       hardware specs. It is also very important  to  include  as
       much  info  as  possible about the Xserver the problem was
       found on including at least server name, the  visual,  and
       the bit depth.

       If  a bug is causing a crash, it is very useful if a stack
       trace can be provided. And of course, patches  to  rectify
       the bug are even better.


OTHER INFO
       The   canonical   place   to   find   GIMP   info   is  at
       http://www.gimp.org/.  Here you can  find  links  to  just

       list archives, and more.

       There is also a Gimp User Manual available at  http://man­
       ual.gimp.org/  that  goes  into much more detail about the
       interactive use of Gimp.

       The latest version of Gimp and  the  gtk  libs  is  always
       available at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/.
