NAME
       pamtopnm - convert PAM image to PBM, PGM, or PPM


SYNOPSIS
       pamtopnm [-assume] [pnmfile]

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique pre­
       fix.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PAM image as input.  Produces an  equivalent  PBM,
       PGM,  or PPM (i.e. PNM) image, whichever is most appropri­
       ate, as output.

       pamtopnm assumes the PAM image represents the  information
       required for a PBM, PGM, or PPM image if its tuple type is
       "BLACKANDWHITE", "GRAYSCALE", or "RGB" and its  depth  and
       maxval are appropriate.  If this is not the case, pamtopnm
       fails.

       However, you can override the tuple type requirement  with
       the -assume option.

       As with any Netpbm program that reads PAM images, pamtopnm
       also reads PNM images as if they were PAM.  In that  case,
       pamtopnm's  functions  reduces to simply copying the input
       to the output.  But this can be useful in a  program  that
       doesn't  know whether its input is PAM or PNM but needs to
       feed it to a program that only recognizes PNM.


OPTIONS
       -assume
              When you specify -assume, you  tell  pamtopnm  that
              you  personally  vouch for the fact that the tuples
              contain the same data as belongs in the channels of
              a PBM, PGM, or PPM file.  The depth must still con­
              form, though, so to truly force a  conversion,  you
              may have to run the input through pamchannel first.
              But be careful with -assume.  When you -assume, you
              make an -ass of u and me.
