NAME
       grodvi - convert groff output to TeX dvi format

SYNOPSIS
       grodvi [ -dv ] [ -wn ] [ -Fdir ] [ files...  ]

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between a command line
       option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grodvi is a driver for groff that produces TeX dvi format.
       Normally  it  should be run by groff -Tdvi.  This will run
       troff -Tdvi;   it   will    also    input    the    macros
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/dvi.tmac;  if  the  input  is
       being  preprocessed  with   eqn   it   will   also   input
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/eqnchar.

       The  dvi  file  generated  by grodvi can be printed by any
       correctly-written dvi driver.  The  troff  drawing  primi­
       tives  are  implemented using the tpic version 2 specials.
       If the driver does not support these, the \D commands will
       not produce any output.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw  a rule (solid black rectangle), with one cor­
              ner at the current  position,  and  the  diagonally
              opposite  corner  at the current position +(dh,dv).
              Afterwards the current  position  will  be  at  the
              opposite  corner.   This produces a rule in the dvi
              file and so can be printed even with a driver  that
              does not support the tpic specials unlike the other
              \D commands.

       The groff command \X'anything' is translated into the same
       command  in  the  dvi  file  as would be produced by \spe­
       cial{anything} in TeX; anything may not contain a newline.

       Font  files for grodvi can be created from tfm files using
       tfmtodit(1).  The font description file should contain the
       following additional commands:

       internalname name
                     The  name  of the tfm file (without the .tfm
                     extension) is name.

       checksum n    The checksum in the tfm file is n.

       designsize n  The designsize in the tfm file is n.

       These are automatically generated by tfmtodit.

       In troff the \N escape sequence  can  be  used  to  access
       characters  by  their  position  in  the corresponding tfm
       file; all characters in the tfm file can be accessed  this
       way.

OPTIONS
       -d     Do  not use tpic specials to implement drawing com­
              mands.   Horizontal  and  vertical  lines  will  be
              implemented  by rules.  Other drawing commands will
              be ignored.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wn    Set the default line thickness to n thousandths  of
              an em.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devdvi to the search path for
              font and device description files.

FILES
       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/DESC
              Device description file.

       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/F
              Font description file for font F.

       /usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/dvi.tmac
              Macros for use with grodvi.

BUGS
       Dvi files produced by grodvi use  a  different  resolution
       (57816  units  per inch) to those produced by TeX.  Incor­
       rectly written drivers which assume the resolution used by
       TeX, rather than using the resolution specified in the dvi
       file will not work with grodvi.

       When using the -d option with boxed tables,  vertical  and
       horizontal  lines  can  sometimes  protrude  by one pixel.
       This is a consequence of the way  TeX  requires  that  the
       heights and widths of rules be rounded.
