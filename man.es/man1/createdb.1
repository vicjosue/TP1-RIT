NAME
       createdb - create a new PostgreSQL database

SYNOPSIS
       createdb [ options... ] [ dbname ] [ description ]

   INPUTS
       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server is running. If host begins with a slash,  it
              is  used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies the Internet TCP/IP  port  or  the  local
              Unix  domain  socket  file  extension  on which the
              server is listening for connections.

       -U, --username username
              User name to connect as

       -W, --password
              Force password prompt.

       -e, --echo
              Echo the queries that createdb generates and  sends
              to the server.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display a response.

       -D, --location datadir
              Specifies   the   alternative   location   for  the
              database. See also initlocation(1).

       -T, --template template
              Specifies the template database from which to build
              this database.

       -E, --encoding encoding
              Specifies  the character encoding scheme to be used
              in this database.

       dbname Specifies the name of the database to  be  created.
              The  name  must  be  unique  among  all  PostgreSQL
              databases in this installation.  The default is  to
              create a database with the same name as the current
              system user.

       description
              This optionally specifies a comment to  be  associ­
              ated with the newly created database.

       The options -h, -p, -U, -W, and -e are passed on literally
       to psql(1).  The options -D, -T, and -E are converted into
       options  for  the  underlying  SQL command CREATE DATABASE
       [create_database(7)]; see there for more information about
       them.

   OUTPUTS
       CREATE DATABASE
              The database was successfully created.

       createdb: Database creation failed.
              (Says it all.)

       createdb: Comment creation failed. (Database was created.)
              The  comment/description for the database could not
              be created.  The database  itself  will  have  been
              created  already.  You can use the SQL command COM­
              MENT ON DATABASE to create the comment later on.

       If there is an error condition, the backend error  message
       will    be   displayed.    See   CREATE   DATABASE   [cre­
       ate_database(7)] and psql(1) for possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       createdb creates a new PostgreSQL database. The  user  who
       executes this command becomes the database owner.

       createdb  is a shell script wrapper around the SQL command
       CREATE DATABASE [create_database(7)]  via  the  PostgreSQL
       interactive  terminal psql(1). Thus, there is nothing spe­
       cial about creating databases via this or  other  methods.
       This  means  that  the  psql  program must be found by the
       script and that a database server must be running  at  the
       targeted  port. Also, any default settings and environment
       variables  available  to  psql  and  the  libpq  front-end
       library will apply.

USAGE
       To  create  the  database  demo using the default database
       server:

       $ createdb demo
       CREATE DATABASE

       The response is the same as you  would  have  gotten  from
       running the CREATE DATABASE SQL command.


       To create the database demo using the server on host eden,
       port 5000, using the LATIN1 encoding scheme with a look at
       the underlying query:

       $ createdb -p 5000 -h eden -E LATIN1 -e demo
       CREATE DATABASE "demo" WITH ENCODING = 'LATIN1'
       CREATE DATABASE
