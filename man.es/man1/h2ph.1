       h2ph converts any C header files specified to the corre­
       sponding Perl header file format.  It is most easily run
       while in /usr/include:

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .

       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at
       Perl's architecture dependent library directory.  You can
       specify a different hierarchy with a --dd switch.

       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to stan­
       dard output.

           Put the resulting ..pphh files beneath ddeessttiinnaattiioonn_ddiirr,
           instead of beneath the default Perl library location
           ("$Config{'installsitsearch'}").

       -r  Run recursively; if any of hheeaaddeerrffiilleess are directo­
           ries, then run h2ph on all files in those directories
           (and their subdirectories, etc.).  --rr and --aa are mutu­
           ally exclusive.

       -a  Run automagically; convert hheeaaddeerrffiilleess, as well as any
           ..hh files which they include.  This option will search
           for ..hh files in all directories which your C compiler
           ordinarily uses.  --aa and --rr are mutually exclusive.

       -l  Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination
           directory.  If --ll is not specified, then links are
           skipped over.

       -h  Put ``hints'' in the .ph files which will help in
           locating problems with h2ph.  In those cases when you
           rreeqquuiirree a ..pphh file containing syntax errors, instead
           of the cryptic

                   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn

           you will see the slightly more helpful

                   [ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn

           However, the ..pphh files almost double in size when
           built using --hh.

       -D  Include the code from the ..hh file as a comment in the
           ..pphh file.  This is primarily used for debugging h2ph.


       -Q  ``Quiet'' mode; don't print out the names of the files
           being converted.

       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It doesn't handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to
       isolate definitions inside evals so that you can get at
       the definitions that it can translate.

       It's only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to
       dicker with the files produced.

       You have to run this program by hand; it's not run as part
       of the Perl installation.

       Doesn't handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a
       la:

           enum {
               FIRST_VALUE,
               SECOND_VALUE,
           #ifdef ABC
               THIRD_VALUE
           #endif
           };

       Doesn't necessarily locate all of your C compiler's inter­
       nally-defined symbols.
