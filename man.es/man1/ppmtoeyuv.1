NAME
       ppmtoeyuv  - convert a portable pixmap into a Berkeley YUV
       file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoeyuv [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as  input.   Produces  a  Berkeley
       Encoder YUV (not the same as Abekas YUV) file on the Stan­
       dard Output file.

       With no argument, takes input from Standard Input.  Other­
       wise, ppmfile is the file specification of the input file.

       ppmtoeyuv handles  multi-image  PPM  input  streams,  out­
       putting  consecutive  eyuv images.  There must be at least
       one image, though.
