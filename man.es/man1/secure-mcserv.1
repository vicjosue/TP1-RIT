NAME secure-mcserv
       secure-mcserv  -  secure  server for encrypted login, file
       transfer and socket forwarding.

SYNOPSIS
       secure-mcserv [options] [-p portnum]

DESCRIPTION
       secure-mcserv is a server for the Midnight Commander (net­
       work)  filesystem  (mcfs)  of  the  Midnight Commander vfs
       (virtual file system).  It is part of the mirrordir  pack­
       age.  In  can operate as a substitute to the Midnight Com­
       mander's native mcserv daemon,  although  It  has  several
       extensions for use with mirrordir.

       security and compression
              This  is  not so much a feature of secure-mcserv as
              of the transparent secure TCP layer implemented for
              the  whole  of mirrordir. This layer can operate in
              normal mode, compressed (gzipped)  mode,  encrypted
              mode, or compressed and encrypted mode. The mode of
              connection is autodetected from  magic  numbers  at
              the  head of the TCP stream. The Midnight Commander
              can use secure-mcserv instead of its native mcserv.
              See  the  -z,  --secure  and  -K  options  of  mir­
              rordir(1).

       Denying access from specific hosts
              You can add to  your  /etc/hosts.allow  file  lines
              like the following:

                  secure-mcserv:  <source-ip-address> : ALLOW
                  secure-mcserv:  212.89.128.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
                  secure-mcserv:  ALL : DENY

              (This feature was submitted to me by Juergen Kammer
              <j.kammer@eurodata.de> who claims it works.)

       logins You can securely login to secure-mcserv with  pslo­
              gin  which  comes  with the mirrordir distribution.
              This  is  analogous  to  rlogin(1)   working   with
              rlogind(1).  See  the  --login-mode  option of mir­
              rordir(1).

       TCP socket forwarding
              Using the forward(1) command of the mirrordir  dis­
              tribution,  you  can  forward  arbitrary TCP socket
              connections over a  secure  and/or  compressed  TCP
              channel.  This  is very useful for making encrypted
              services out of ordinary services.  forward(1)  has
              an examples section.

OPTIONS
       -d     Become  a  daemon (set -q). This option will almost
              always be used.  Alternative -d can be omitted  and
              -v (see below) set to debug failed connections.

       -q     Quiet mode. This is the default.

       -f     Try  ftp  authentication  if  normal authentication
              fails.

       -v     Verbose mode. Print out various debugging  informa­
              tion.

       -p port
              Specify  a port number to listen to. The default is
              9876.

       -s server[:port]
              Specify a password  server  to  use.  The  password
              server  is  just  another  machine  running secure-
              mcserv albeit without the -s option.

              This is a very useful option if you  have  lots  of
              machines  that  a group of users have to be able to
              log into. Create accounts for all  these  users  on
              each  machine  and  disable  them  by editing their
              password  fields  to   *   in   /etc/password   (or
              /etc/shadow).

              Select  one machine as your password server (say it
              is called passerv.my.doma.in).  This  machine  will
              contain proper password fields in /etc/password. On
              this machine run secure-mcserv -d as usual. On  all
              other    machines,    run   secure-mcserv   -d   -s
              passerv.my.doma.in

              Because all intermediate connections use  the  same
              encrypted  TCP  stream, and are all equally secure,
              you can use this method even if  passerv.my.doma.in
              is  across  the  open  internet.  In  fact the very
              method to authenticate against the password  server
              is to check the exit status of the command:
              pslogin user@passerv.my.doma.in --test-login --read-password-from-stdin

              I  also  see no reason why you cannot use cascading
              password servers, although there is no advantage to
              doing this.

              Each authentication takes the same time to execute,
              so using a password server takes twice as long as a
              normal  login,  because of the second connection it
              has to make to the password server.  Cascades  will
              take that much time extra for each successive pass­
              word server.

BUGS
       Does not log to syslog.

       Midnight Commander vfs has a bug  that  device  files  are
       always  major:minor  of  0:0.  This  bug  is fixed in this
       implementation.   Don't  use  the  Midnight  Commander  to
       transfer device files. By the time you read this, the lat­
       est Midnight Commander may have had this fixed.

       The special escape characters  for  suspending  an  rlogin
       session are not recognised. Hence programs like screen (?)
       will not work. I will  add  this  functionality  if  users
       request it. Currently, ^Z etc. do not have any effect.
