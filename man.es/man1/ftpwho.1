NAME
       ftpwho  -  show  current  process information for each ftp
       user

SYNOPSIS
       ftpwho

DESCRIPTION
       The ftpwho  command  shows  process  information  for  all
       active  proftpd  connections, and a count of all connected
       users off of each server.  Proftpd sesssions spawned  from
       inetd  are counted seperately from those created by a mas­
       ter proftpd standalone server.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display a short usage  description,  including
                   all available options.

       -p,--path scoreboard-path
                   Specify  the  full  path to proftpd's run-time
                   scoreboard files (configured  via  the  Score­
                   boardPath   directive  in  proftpd.conf).   If
                   proftpd's default directory has  been  changed
                   via  this  directive,  ftpwho  must  either be
                   recompiled, or this option  must  be  used  in
                   order to find proftpd's scoreboard.

       -v,--verbose
                   Reports  additional  information for each con­
                   nection, such as the remote host  and  current
                   working directory.
