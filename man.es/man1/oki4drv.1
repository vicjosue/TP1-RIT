OKI4DRV(l)                                             OKI4DRV(l)



NAME
       oki4drv - User space based driver for OKIPAGE 4w, OKI400w,
       OKIPAGE 4w PLUS and OKIPAGE 8w Lite printers.

SYNTAX
       oki4drv [-gmvV] [-s papersize]  [-o output]  [-d darkness]
       [-w paperweight] [[file]...]

DESCRIPTION
       oki4drv  is  a  user  level  driver  for  the OKIPAGE 4w ,
       OKIPAGE 4w PLUS , as well  as  the  OKIPAGE  8w  Lite  GDI
       (Generic Display Interface) printers.

       It takes PostScript input from some files specified on the
       command line or  from  standard  input  and  renders  them
       through  GhostScript's  raw  bit  device.  The GhostScript
       output will be coded into a data  stream  appropriate  for
       those printers and spooled page by page sendid directly to
       the printer device itself. The default printer device file
       used is: /dev/lp0.

       WARNING!

       Due to the printing technology involved the feeding of the
       printer with data imposes some  real-time  constraints  on
       the  run  of  this  program.  The document processing must
       therefore be done on a page by page basis. The host system
       should  be fairly well equipped to keep up with the print­
       ers hunger for data. Supposedly  an  486  with  about  16M
       bytes  of  RAM  should  do it. But please don't try to use
       this program with one of those  printers  on  an  in  esp.
       386SX/16MHz  with  4  megs of RAM! I'm personally using an
       K6/333MHz with 64M bytes of RAM and can't  therefore  tell
       what the real lower limit is.

       However: be warned!  Failing to meet those constraints may
       result in  severe physical damage to the printer!  Thought
       it  shouldn't,  since I have been observing those printers
       ability to stop and resume in the middle of  processing  a
       sheet  of  paper.   It appears that this behavior involves
       some control from the computers side, so I can't really at
       this stage of developement reproduce it.

       Please  make  sure  that  the printer is set to EPP or SPP
       mode in the BIOS!  ECP will fail for reasons I don't  want
       to explain in length here.

       To  guarantee  a quite continuous data stream, the process
       of sending the page image data to the printer is exploring
       real  time  and execution priority manipulation facilities
       of the underlying operating system. As a consequence  this
       program  must be used in SUID root mode. The second conse­
       quence of this is that it doesn't make sense to  use  this
       program  in  pure filtering mode under the control of some
       systems printer spooling daemon  like  for  example:  lpd.
       Sorry but that's just like the live is. However the user's
       inconvenience should remain quite moderate.

       If you expirence problems try first  to  output  the  data
       into  a  separate  file  and  thereafter  to cat it to the
       printer at once like this:

       oki4drv foo.ps -o temp; cat temp > /dev/lp0.

       And make sure that the machine you are using is  otherwise
       idle.



OPTIONS
       The options recognized by this program are:

       -g     Render in graphics mode instead of text mode, which
              is the default.

       -m     Use the manual paper feed instead  of  the  default
              automatic.

       -s papersize
              Specify   the  paper  size.  Possible  values  are:
              a4,a5,a6,b5,letter,legal The default value  is  the
              European a4.

       -o /dev/foo
              Specify and alternative printer device file name or
              any file if you wish to cat the data to the printer
              after  fully finished rendering.  The default value
              is: /dev/lp0.

       -d darkness
              Specify the darkness value in the range from -2  to
              2,  from  dark to light.  0 (medium) is the default
              value.

       -w weight
              Specify the paper weight in the range from -2 to 2,
              from  heavy  to  light.   0  (heavy) is the default
              value.

       -v     Prints the version information and exit.

       -V     Run in verbose mode diving information  about  run­
              ning status and currently processed pages in a for­
              mat similar to the one used by the TeX tools.


REQUIREMENTS
       You will need the excellent  GhostScript  interpreter  for
       the PostScript language to use this program.


BUGS
       There  are  currently  no known bugs in the driver program
       itself, other then of linguistic nature  in  comments  and
       documentation.  The only bogusity accounts go to OKIDATA -
       which didn't give me any documentation about the protocols
       used by those printers in first place!

       However  please  note  that this is no longer true at all!
       They even prvided me for free with  a  recent  model  from
       them!

       So  all Linux/UNIX enthusiasts out there please note: OKI­
       DATA is making fine printers for desktop usage, where it's
       really  fine to use the power of the host CPU for the ren­
       dering of the data.  They have IMHO the best price to per­
       formace ratio out there one can imagine!

       With  the  latest 2.0.3x series of kernels there appear to
       be some bogus workarounds for bugs in the interface proto­
       col  handling, which are preventing this driver from work­
       ing properly. Recent 2.2 (namely  2.2.9  and  later)  work
       fine  again.  I  have only tested this driver release upon
       2.2.9 as of now. If the situtation remains that the  Linux
       printer  driver once works and once fails again version by
       version, I will start to include a propper working  driver
       in the package too.
