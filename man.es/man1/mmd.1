Name
       mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory



Note of warning
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.


Description
       The mmd command is used to make  an  MS-DOS  subdirectory.
       Its syntax is:

       mmd [-D clash_option] msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories...
       ]

       Mmd makes a new directory  on  an  MS-DOS  filesystem.  An
       error occurs if the directory already exists.

Viewing the texi doc
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

              A     premade     html    can    be    found    at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'     and      also      at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To  generate  an  info copy (browsable using emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
