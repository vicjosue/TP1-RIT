TZSELECT(1)           Timezone Configuration          TZSELECT(1)



NAME
       tzselect - view timezones

SYNOPSIS
       tzselect

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  explains  how you can use the tzselect
       utility to view the installed  timezone.  It  comes  handy
       when  you want to know what time it is in other countries,
       or if you just wonder what timezones exist.

       Nothe that timeconfig will not actually change  the  time­
       zone  for  you.  Use  the timeconfig(8) utility to achieve
       this.
