NAME
       apmsleep  -  go  into  suspend or standby mode and wake-up
       later

SYNOPSIS
       apmsleep  [-sSnwhVd]  [--suspend]  [--standby]   [--noapm]
       [--wait] [--help]  [--version] [--debug] [+]hh:mm

DESCRIPTION
       Some  computers,  especially  laptops,  can wake-up from a
       low-power suspend to DRAM mode using  the  Real-time-clock
       (RTC) chip.  Apmsleep can be used to set the alarm time in
       the RTC and to go into suspend or standby mode. An  inter­
       rupt  from  the  RTC  causes the computer to wake-up.  The
       program detects this event, by waiting for a leap  in  the
       kernel  time  and terminates successfully. If no time leap
       occurs within one minute, or  something  goes  wrong,  the
       exit value will be non-zero.

       The wake-up time can be specified in two formats:

       +hh:mm  specifies  a  relative offset to the current time.
       The computer will suspend for exactly hh hours and mm min­
       utes plus a few seconds to wake up.

       hh:mm specifies absolute local time in 24-hour format. The
       time stored in the RTC is not important.  You  may  change
       the  time  zone  used, with the TZ environment variable as
       usual. Daylight saving time is not obeyed in this version,
       but might be in a future release.

       -V, --version
              Print the apmsleep program version and exit immedi­
              ately.

       -s, --suspend
              Put the  machine  into  suspend  mode  if  possible
              (default).  On  my  laptop,  suspend mode turns off
              everything except the memory.

       -S, --standby
              Put the machine into standby mode if  possible.  On
              my  laptop,  standby  mode  turns  off screen, hard
              disk, and CPU.

       -w, --wait
              Wait indefinitely for the time leap.

       -n, --noapm
              Do not call /usr/bin/apm to suspend computer,  just
              set the alarm clock and wait for time leap.

       -d, --debug
              Print some information about what is going on.

REQUIRED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
       Kernel The  special  character  device /dev/rtc must exist
              and the Linux kernel needs to be compiled with  APM
              and  RTC  support  (CONFIG_RTC,  and  relevant CON­
              FIG_APM* options).

       BIOS   The computer must have the 'suspend to RAM' feature
              enabled  in  the  BIOS;  'suspend to Disk' will not
              work, because  the  computer  is  turned  off  com­
              pletely. You do not need to enable the ALARM timer,
              it will be activated by apmsleep. On  some  boards,
              you  can  configure which interrupts can be used to
              awake from suspend mode. If you have such a  board,
              you  might  want to make sure that keyboard (IRQ 1)
              and RTC (IRQ 8) are among those interrupts.

       Privileges
              The program must be run as root or  have  the  SUID
              attribute set (see chmod(1)).


BUGS
       Apmsleep  cannot detect which event terminated the suspen­
       sion. Possible events are:  keyboard  or  mouse  activity,
       modem ring, alarm from RTC, any other interrupt.

       This  program  was tested on a Winbook XL laptop (Pentium)
       only.  It may not function on your hardware.
