NAME
       ogg123 - plays Ogg Vorbis files


SYNOPSIS
       ogg123  [ -vqzVh ] [ -k seconds ] [ -x nth ] [ -y ntimes ]
       [ -b buffer_size ] [ -d driver [ -o option:value  ]  [  -f
       filename ] ] file ...  | URL ...


DESCRIPTION
       ogg123  reads  Ogg  Vorbis audio files and decodes them to
       the devices specified on the command  line.   By  default,
       ogg123 writes to the standard sound device, but output can
       be sent to any number of devices.  Files can be read  from
       the file system, or URLs can be streamed via HTTP.


OPTIONS
       -b n, --buffer n
              Use an input buffer of approximately 'n' kilobytes.

       -p n, --prebuffer n
              Prebuffer 'n' percent of the input  buffer.   Play­
              back  won't begin until this prebuffer is complete.

       -d device, --device device
              Specify output device.  See DEVICES section  for  a
              list  of  devices.   Any  number  of devices may be
              specified.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Specify output file for file devices.  The filename
              "-"  writes  to  standard out.  If the file already
              exists, ogg123 will overwrite it.

       -h, --help
              Show command help.

       -k n, --skip n
              Skip the first 'n' seconds

       -o option:value, --device-option option:value
              Assigns the option option to value for the  preced­
              ing  device.   See  DEVICES  for  a  list  of valid
              options for each device.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity.

       -x n, --nth
              Play every 'n'th decoded block.  Has the effect  of
              playing  audio  at  'n'  times  faster  than normal
              speed.

       -y n, --ntimes
              Repeat every  played  block  'n'  times.   Has  the
              effect  of playing audio 'n' times slower than nor­
              mal speed.  May be with -x  for  interesting  frac­
              tional speeds.

       -z, --shuffle
              Play files in pseudo-random order.


DEVICES
       ogg123  supports a variety of audio output devices through
       libao.  Only those devices supported by the  target  plat­
       form  will  be  available.  The -f option may only be used
       with devices that write to files.


       null   Null driver.  All audio data is discarded.   (Note:
              Audio  data  is  not  written  to /dev/null !)  You
              could use this driver to test  raw  decoding  speed
              without output overhead.


       oss    Open Sound System driver for Linux and FreeBSD.
              Options:

                      dsp    DSP  device for soundcard.  Defaults
                             to /dev/dsp.


       sun    Sun Audio driver for NetBSD, OpenBSD, and  Solaris.
              Options:

                      dev    Audio    device    for    soundcard.
                             Defaults to /dev/audio.


       alsa   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
              Options:

                      card   Sound card number.  (Default = 0)

                      dev    Device number  on  the  sound  card.
                             (Default = 0)

                     buf_size
                             Override the default buffer size (in
                             bytes).


       irix   IRIX audio driver.  Note that this driver  has  not
              been tested!


       arts   aRts Sound Daemon.


       esd    Enlightened Sound Daemon.
              Options:

                      host   The  hostname  where esd is running.
                             This can include a port number after
                             a  colon,  as in "whizbang.com:555".
                             (Default = localhost)


       au     Sun audio file output.  Writes the audio samples in
              AU  format.   The  AU  format  supports  writing to
              unseekable files, like standard out.  In such  cir­
              cumstances,  the  AU header will specify the sample
              format, but not the length of the recording.


       raw    Raw sample output.  Writes raw audio samples  to  a
              file.
              Options:

                     byteorder
                             Choose big endian, little endian, or
                             native  byte  order.    (Default   =
                             "native")


       wav    WAV  file output.  Writes the sound data to disk in
              uncompressed form.  If multiple files  are  played,
              all  of them will be concatenated into the same WAV
              file.  WAV files cannot be  written  to  unseekable
              files,  such  as  standard  out.  Use the AU format
              instead.



EXAMPLES
       The ogg123 command line is fairly flexible,  perhaps  con­
       fusingly  so.   Here  are some sample command lines and an
       explanation of what they do.


       Play on the default soundcard:
              ogg123 test.ogg


       Play using the OSS driver:
              ogg123 -d oss test.ogg


       Pass the "dsp" option to the OSS driver:
              ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp


       Use the ESD driver
              ogg123 -d esd test.ogg


       Use the WAV driver with the output file, "test.wav":
              ogg123 -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg


       Listen to a file while you write it to a WAV file:
              ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg


       Note that options apply to  the  device  declared  to  the
       left:
              ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp -d raw -f test2.raw
              -o byteorder:big test.ogg


       Stress test your harddrive:
              ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f 1.wav -d wav  -f  2.wav  -d
              wav  -f  3.wav  -d  wav  -f  4.wav  -d wav -f 5.wav
              test.ogg


       Create an echo effect with esd and a slow computer:
              ogg123 -d esd -d esd test.ogg



INTERRUPT
       You can abort ogg123 at any time by pressing  Ctrl-C.   If
       you are playing multiple files, this will stop the current
       file and begin playing the next one.  If you want to abort
       playing  immediately instead of skipping to the next file,
       press Ctrl-C within the first second of the playback of  a
       new file.

       Note that the result of pressing Ctrl-C might not be audi­
       ble immediately, due to audio data buffering in the  audio
       device.  This delay is system dependent, but it is usually
       not more than one or two seconds.


FILES
       /etc/libao.conf
              Can be used to set the default  output  device  for
              all libao programs.


       ~/.libao
              Per-user  config  file  to override the system wide
              output device settings.



BUGS
       Piped WAV files may cause strange behavior in  other  pro­
       grams.  This is because WAV files store the data length in
       the header.  However, the output driver does not know  the
       length  when  it  writes the header, and there is no value
       that means "length unknown".  Use the  raw  or  au  output
       driver if you need to use ogg123 in a pipe.
