IDENT(1)                                                 IDENT(1)



NAME
       ident - identify RCS keyword strings in files

SYNOPSIS
       ident [ -q ] [ -V ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       ident  searches  for  all  instances  of the pattern $key­
       word: text $ in the named files or, if no files are named,
       the standard input.

       These  patterns are normally inserted automatically by the
       RCS command co(1), but can also be inserted manually.  The
       option  -q  suppresses  the  warning given if there are no
       patterns in a file.  The option -V prints ident's  version
       number.

       ident  works  on  text  files  as well as object files and
       dumps.  For example, if the C program in f.c contains

              #include <stdio.h>
              static char const rcsid[] =
                "$Id: f.c,v 5.4 1993/11/09  17:40:15  eggert  Exp
              $";
              int main() { return printf("%s\n", rcsid) == EOF; }

       and f.c is compiled into f.o, then the command

              ident  f.c  f.o

       will output

              f.c:
                  $Id: f.c,v 5.4 1993/11/09 17:40:15 eggert Exp $
              f.o:
                  $Id: f.c,v 5.4 1993/11/09 17:40:15 eggert Exp $

       If a C program defines a string like rcsid above but  does
       not  use  it,  lint(1)  may complain, and some C compilers
       will optimize away the string.  The most reliable solution
       is  to  have the program use the rcsid string, as shown in
       the example above.

       ident finds all instances of the $keyword: text $ pattern,
       even  if keyword is not actually an RCS-supported keyword.
       This gives you information about nonstandard keywords like
       $XConsortium$.

KEYWORDS
       Here  is  the  list  of  keywords  currently maintained by
       co(1).  All times are given in Coordinated Universal  Time
       (UTC,  sometimes  called GMT) by default, but if the files
       were checked out with co's -zzone option, times are  given
       with a numeric time zone indication appended.

       $Author$
              The login name of the user who checked in the revi­
              sion.

       $Date$ The date and time the revision was checked in.

       $Header$
              A standard header containing the full  pathname  of
              the  RCS  file,  the  revision number, the date and
              time, the author, the state,  and  the  locker  (if
              locked).

       $Id$   Same  as  $Header$, except that the RCS filename is
              without a path.

       $Locker$
              The login name of the user who locked the  revision
              (empty if not locked).

       $Log$  The  log  message  supplied  during  checkin.   For
              ident's purposes, this is equivalent to  $RCSfile$.

       $Name$ The  symbolic  name used to check out the revision,
              if any.

       $RCSfile$
              The name of the RCS file without a path.

       $Revision$
              The revision number assigned to the revision.

       $Source$
              The full pathname of the RCS file.

       $State$
              The state assigned to  the  revision  with  the  -s
              option of rcs(1) or ci(1).

       co(1)  represents the following characters in keyword val­
       ues by escape sequences  to  keep  keyword  strings  well-
       formed.

              char     escape sequence
              tab      \t
              newline  \n
              space    \040
              $        \044
              \        \\
