pnminterp-gen(1)                                 pnminterp-gen(1)



NAME
       pnminterp-gen  -  use  pnminterp  and pnmscale to scale by
       non-integer values

SYNOPSIS
       pnminterp-gen N [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Pnminterp-gen is a shell script which  uses  pnminterp(1),
       pnmfile(1),  and  pnmscale(1)  to  smoothly scale up a PNM
       file by any ratio; it's like a  more  general  version  of
       pnminterp (hence the name). But other than the `any ratio'
       bit, it's much the same as pnminterp. :-)

BUGS
       Uses awk just to make some simple floating-point  calcula­
       tions,  which  is probably overkill. But using dc makes my
       head hurt.

SEE ALSO
       pnminterp(1), pnmscale(1)
