READ-ICAL(1)                                         READ-ICAL(1)



NAME
       read-ical  -  coverts  information  on your Palm Computing
       Device into an Ical-formatted calendar

SYNOPSIS
       read-ical /dev/tty[<0..n>] filename

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents  the  small  application  read-
       ical.   read-ical allows the user to retrieve the contents
       of the ToDo and Datebook databases on a a Pilot, and  con­
       vert  their  contents to an Ical calendar.  Once read-ical
       is started, the user must invoke  HotSync  on  the  target
       device.

       Note  that  the  calendar  file  named by filename will be
       deleted, so do not use your main calendar. Instead, use  a
       separate one for this purpose, and include it in your main
       calendar.

       As read-ical works by passing a script to ical, ical  must
       be in your path.

   OPTIONS
       <port> <filename>

USEAGE
       The  program will connect to a target device, retrieve the
       ToDo and Datebook databases (ToDoDB.pdb and DatebookDB.pdb
       respectively), then instruct ical to write a calendar file
       based on the retrieved information.
