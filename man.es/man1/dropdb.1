NAME
       dropdb - remove a PostgreSQL database

SYNOPSIS
       dropdb [ options... ] dbname

   INPUTS
       -h, --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server is running. If host begins with a slash,  it
              is  used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix domain
              socket.

       -p, --port port
              Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port  or  local  Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -U, --username username
              User name to connect as

       -W, --password
              Force password prompt.

       -e, --echo
              Echo the queries that dropdb generates and sends to
              the server.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display a response.

       -i, --interactive
              Issues  a verification prompt before doing anything
              destructive.

       dbname Specifies the name of the database to  be  removed.
              The database must be one of the existing PostgreSQL
              databases in this installation.

       The options -h, -p, -U, -W, and -e are passed on literally
       to psql(1).

   OUTPUTS
       DROP DATABASE
              The database was successfully removed.

       dropdb: Database removal failed.
              Something didn't work out.

       If  there is an error condition, the backend error message
       will be displayed.  See DROP  DATABASE  [drop_database(7)]
       and psql(1) for possibilities.

DESCRIPTION
       dropdb destroys an existing PostgreSQL database.  The user
       who executes this command must be a database superuser  or
       the owner of the database.

       dropdb  is  a  shell script wrapper around the SQL command
       DROP DATABASE [drop_database(7)] via the PostgreSQL inter­
       active  terminal  psql(1).  Thus, there is nothing special
       about dropping databases via this or other  methods.  This
       means that the psql must be found by the script and that a
       database server is running at the targeted host. Also, any
       default  settings  and  environment variables available to
       psql and the libpq front-end library do apply.

USAGE
       To destroy the  database  demo  on  the  default  database
       server:

       $ dropdb demo
       DROP DATABASE



       To  destroy  the  database  demo  using the server on host
       eden, port 5000, with  verification  and  a  peek  at  the
       underlying query:

       $ dropdb -p 5000 -h eden -i -e demo
       Database "demo" will be permanently deleted.
       Are you sure? (y/n) y
       DROP DATABASE "demo"
       DROP DATABASE
