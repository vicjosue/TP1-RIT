J-PILOT-UPGRADE-99(1)                       J-PILOT-UPGRADE-99(1)



NAME
       jpilot-upgrade-99  -  A tool for upgrading pre 0.99 jpilot
       databases to jpilot version 0.99 databases

       jpilot is a palm pilot desktop for Linux/Unix

SYNOPSIS
       jpilot-upgrade-99

DESCRIPTION
       Upgrading to 0.99 from a pre 0.99 release:

       I changed the .pc file  format.   J-Pilot  now  uses  .pc3
       files to store desktop records.

       This  was necessary to make it machine byte order indepen­
       dent.  The .pc3 files  should  now  work  on  NFS  mounted
       drives  from  different architectures and you can ftp them
       to other machines with different byte orders, etc.

       This may make plugins need  to  be  recompiled,  or  maybe
       changed, but I feel this change had to be made before ver­
       sion 1.0.

       You should sync before upgrading to 0.99 from  an  earlier
       version.   However if you can't or forgot, then you should
       sync and then run jpilot-upgrade-99 and  it  will  convert
       the .pc files to .pc3 files.
