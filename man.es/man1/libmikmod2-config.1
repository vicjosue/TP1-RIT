LIBMIKMOD(1)                                         LIBMIKMOD(1)



NAME
       libmikmod-config  -  script  to  get information about the
       installed version of libmikmod.


SYNOPSIS
       libmikmod-config  [--prefix[=DIR]]   [--exec-prefix[=DIR]]
       [--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [--ldadd]


DESCRIPTION
       libmikmod-config  is  a  tool that is used to configure to
       determine the compiler and linker  flags  that  should  be
       used  to  compile and link programs that use libmikmod. It
       is also used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf
       that are included with libmikmod.


OPTIONS
       libmikmod-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libmikmod
               on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to  link
               a libmikmod program.

       --ldadd Print the extra linker flags that are necessary to
               link a libmikmod program if it was  compiled  with
               the GNU C compiler.

       --cflags
               Print  the  compiler  flags  that are necessary to
               compile a libmikmod program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the  installa­
               tion  prefix  that  libmikmod  was built with when
               computing the output for the --cflags  and  --libs
               options.  This  option  is  also used for the exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was  not  specified.  This
               option  must  be  specified  before  any --libs or
               --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the  installa­
               tion  exec  prefix  that  libmikmod was built with
               when computing the output  for  the  --cflags  and
               --libs  options.   This  option  must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
