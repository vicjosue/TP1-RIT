NAME
       vacuumdb   -  garbage-collect  and  analyze  a  PostgreSQL
       database

SYNOPSIS
       vacuumdb [ connection-options... ] [  [ -d ]  dbname  ]  [
       --full  |  -f  ]  [  --verbose | -v ] [ --analyze | -z ] [
       --table 'table [ ( column [,...] ) ]' ]

       vacuumdb [ connection-options... ] [ --all | -a ] [ --full
       | -f ] [ --verbose | -v ] [ --analyze | -z ]

   INPUTS
       vacuumdb accepts the following command line arguments:

       -d dbname

       --dbname dbname
              Specifies the name of the database to be cleaned or
              analyzed.

       -a

       --all  Vacuum all databases.

       -f

       --full Perform ``full'' vacuuming.

       -v

       --verbose
              Print detailed information during processing.

       -z

       --analyze
              Calculate statistics for use by the optimizer.

       -t table [ (column [,...]) ]

       --table table [ (column [,...]) ]
              Clean or analyze table only.  Column names  may  be
              specified  only  in  conjunction with the --analyze
              option.

              Tip: If you specify columns to vacuum, you probably
              have to escape the parentheses from the shell.



       vacuumdb also accepts the following command line arguments
       for connection parameters:

       -h host

       --host host
              Specifies the host name of the machine on which the
              server  is running. If host begins with a slash, it
              is used  as  the  directory  for  the  Unix  domain
              socket.

       -p port

       --port port
              Specifies  the  Internet  TCP/IP port or local Unix
              domain socket file extension on which the server is
              listening for connections.

       -U username

       --username username
              User name to connect as

       -W

       --password
              Force password prompt.

       -e

       --echo Echo the commands that vacuumdb generates and sends
              to the server.

       -q

       --quiet
              Do not display a response.


   OUTPUTS
       VACUUM Everything went well.

       vacuumdb: Vacuum failed.
              Something went wrong. vacuumdb is  only  a  wrapper
              script.  See  VACUUM  [vacuum(7)] and psql(1) for a
              detailed discussion of error messages and potential
              problems.



DESCRIPTION
       vacuumdb  is a utility for cleaning a PostgreSQL database.
       vacuumdb will also generate internal  statistics  used  by
       the PostgreSQL query optimizer.

       vacuumdb is a shell script wrapper around the backend com­
       mand VACUUM [vacuum(7)]  via  the  PostgreSQL  interactive
       terminal psql(1). There is no effective difference between
       vacuuming databases via this or other methods.  psql  must
       be  found by the script and a database server must be run­
       ning at the targeted host. Also, any default settings  and
       environment  variables  available  to  psql  and the libpq
       front-end library do apply.

USAGE
       To clean the database test:

       $ vacuumdb test



       To clean and analyze for the optimizer  a  database  named
       bigdb:

       $ vacuumdb --analyze bigdb



       To clean a single table foo in a database named xyzzy, and
       analyze a single column bar of the  table  for  the  opti­
       mizer:

       $ vacuumdb --analyze --verbose --table 'foo(bar)' xyzzy
