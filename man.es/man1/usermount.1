USERMOUNT(1)                                         USERMOUNT(1)



NAME
       usermount  - A graphical tool to mount, unmount and format
       filesystems.

SYNOPSIS
       usermount [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       usermount is a graphical tool to  allow  users  to  easily
       manage removable media, such as floppy disks or zip disks.
       When the tool starts  up,  it  scans  /etc/fstab  for  all
       filesystems  that  have  been configured to allow users to
       mount and unmount them.  The filesystem can be mounted  or
       unmounted by pressing the toggle button labeled Mount.

       Also,  if the user has the appropriate permissions for the
       device, the Format button will be active.  This allows the
       user  to  format  disks  using  fdformat  and create a new
       filesystem of the type listed (using mkfs with the  appro­
       priate  option).  Naturally, the user will be prompted for
       confirmation  before  actually  destroying  data  on   the
       device.

       Note  that if a device is already mounted, the format but­
       ton is inactive  for  all  entries  that  share  the  same
       device.

       When run as root, usermount displays all of the entries in
       /etc/fstab rather than just the ones with the user option.

OPTIONS
       This  program has no command line options of it's own, but
       it does take the standard X program options like  -display
       and  such.   See  the X(1) man page for some of the common
       options.

FILES
       /etc/fstab               The system  file  describing  the
                                mountable filesystems.

SEE ALSO
       mount(8), fdformat(8), mkfs(8), fstab(5) X(1)

BUGS
       Mount  entries  with a filesystem type of iso9660 are out­
       right considered CD-ROMs and the format button  is  always
       disabled.

       Mount  entries  for  swap  files  or  partitions  are also
       ignored.  A nice feature might be to allow  root  to  turn
       swap on and off for swap partitions.
