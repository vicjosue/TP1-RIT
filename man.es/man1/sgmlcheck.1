SGMLCHECK(1)                                         SGMLCHECK(1)



NAME
       sgmlcheck  -  check  the  syntax of an SGML-Tools document
       file

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlcheck file[.sgml]

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlcheck runs an SGML parse  on  the  specified  document
       source.   Any  errors are reported to standard output.  No
       formatted version of the source is produced.

       Note that sgmlcheck preprocesses the  SGML  source,  doing
       the  conditionalization  described  by  any  <if></if> and
       <unless></unless> tags.  SGML-Tools document sources  con­
       taining  these tags will confuse a standalone SGML parser.

OPTIONS
       None.  The generic options described in  sgmltools(1)  are
       accepted, but have no effect (except for -D).

FILES
       Many  files  and  executables  in $LINUXDOCLIB and $LINUX­
       DOCBIN are used.

BUGS
       None known.
