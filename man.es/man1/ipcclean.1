NAME
       ipcclean  -  remove  shared  memory and semaphores from an
       aborted PostgreSQL server

SYNOPSIS
       ipcclean

DESCRIPTION
       ipcclean removes all shared memory segments and  semaphore
       sets  owned by the current user. It is intended to be used
       for cleaning up after a crashed PostgreSQL  server  (post­
       master(1)).  Note  that  immediately restarting the server
       will also clean up shared memory and semaphores,  so  this
       command is of little real utility.

       Only  the  database administrator should execute this pro­
       gram as it can cause bizarre behavior (i.e.,  crashes)  if
       run  during  multiuser  execution. If this command is exe­
       cuted while a postmaster is running, the shared memory and
       semaphores  allocated  by  the postmaster will be deleted.
       This will result in  a  general  failure  of  the  backend
       servers started by that postmaster.

NOTES
       This  script is a hack, but in the many years since it was
       written, no one has come up with an equally effective  and
       portable  solution.  Since the postmaster can now clean up
       by itself, it is unlikely that ipcclean will  be  improved
       upon in the future.

       The  script makes assumption about the format of output of
       the ipcs utility which may not be  true  across  different
       operating  systems.   Therefore,  it  may not work on your
       particular OS.
