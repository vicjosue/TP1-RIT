DESCRIPTION
       cdda2wav  can retrieve audio tracks from CDROM drives (see
       README for a list of drives) that are capable  of  reading
       audio data digitally to the host (CDDA).

OPTIONS
       -D device  --device
              uses  device  as  the  source for CDDA reading: For
              example /dev/cdrom for the  cooked_ioctl  interface
              and  Bus,ID,Lun for the generic_scsi interface. The
              device has to correspond with the interface setting
              (see  below).  The setting of the environment vari­
              able CDDA_DEVICE is overridden by this option.

       -A auxdevice  --auxdevice
              uses auxdevice as CDROM drive for ioctl usage.

       -I interface  --interface
              specifies   the   interface   for   CDROM   access:
              generic_scsi  or  (on  Linux,  and FreeBSD systems)
              cooked_ioctl.

       -c channels  --channels
              uses 1 for mono, or 2 for stereo  recording,  or  s
              for stereo recording with both channels swapped.

       -s  --stereo
              sets to stereo recording.

       -m  --mono
              sets to mono recording.

       -x  --max
              sets maximum (CD) quality.

       -b bits  --bits-per-sample
              sets bits per sample per channel: 8, 12 or 16.

       -r rate  --rate
              sets  rate  in samples per second.  Possible values
              are listed with the -R option.

       -a divider  --divider
              sets rate to 44100Hz /  divider.   Possible  values
              are listed with the -R option.

       -R  --dump-rates
              shows   a  list  of  all  sample  rates  and  their
              dividers.

       -P  sectors  --set-overlap
              sets the initial number of overlap sectors for jit­
              ter correction.

       -n sectors  --sectors-per-request
              reads sectors per request.

       -l buffers  --buffers-in-ring
              uses a ring buffer with buffers total.

       -t track+endtrack  --track
              selects  the  start  track  and  optionally the end
              track.

       -i index  --index
              selects the start index.

       -o offset  --offset
              starts offset sectors behind start track (one  sec­
              tor equivalents 1/75 seconds).

       -O  audiotype  --output-format
              can  be  wav (for wav files) or aiff (for apple/sgi
              aiff files) or aifc (for apple/sgi aifc  files)  or
              au  or  sun  (for  sun .au PCM files) or cdr or raw
              (for headerless files to be used for cd writers).

       -C endianess  --cdrom-endianess
              sets endianess of the input  samples  to  'little',
              'big' or 'guess' to override defaults.

       -E endianess  --output-endianess
              sets endianess of the output samples to 'little' or
              'big' to override defaults.

       -d duration  --duration
              sets recording time in seconds or  frames.   Frames
              (sectors)  are  indicated by a 'f' suffix (like 75f
              for 75 sectors).  0 sets the time for whole  track.

       -B  --bulk
              copies each track into a seperate file.

       -w  --wait
              waits for signal, then start recording.

       -F  --find-extremes
              finds extrem amplitudes in samples.

       -G  --find-mono
              finds if input samples are in mono.

       -T  --deemphasize
              undo  the  effect of pre-emphasis in the input sam­
              ples.

       -e  --echo
              copies audio data to sound device e.g.  /dev/dsp.

       -p  percentage --set-pitch
              changes pitch of audio data copied to sound device.

       -v  level  --verbose-level
              prints  verbose information about the CD.  Level is
              a sum of powers of two in the range  0  up  to  63.
              Each  power of two controls the type of information
              to be reported.

              display version of cdda2wav on standard output.

       Defaults depend on the
              Makefile and environment  variable  settings  (cur­
              rently CDDA_DEVICE ).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       CDDA_DEVICE  is  used  to  set the device name. The device
       naming  is  compatible  with  Jörg  Schilling's   cdrecord
       package.

DISCUSSION
       cdda2wav  is able to read parts of an audio CD or multime­
       dia CDROM (containing  audio  parts)  directly  digitally.
       These  parts  can  be  written  to a file, a pipe, or to a
       sound device.

       cdda2wav stands for CDDA to WAV  (where  CDDA  stands  for
       compact  disc digital audio and WAV is a sound sample for­
       mat introduced by MS Windows).   It  allows  copying  CDDA
       audio  data from the CDROM drive into a file on your ram-,
       hard-, floppy- or whatever-disk in WAV or other formats.

       The latest versions try to get higher real-time scheduling
       priorities  to  ensure  smooth  (uninterrupted) operation.
       These priorities are available for  super  users  and  are
       higher  than  those of 'normal' processes. Thus delays are
       minimized.  Please note that you need newer kernels and  c
       libraries to take advantage of this feature.

       If  your  CDROM  (not  yet  for  SCSI drives) is on device
       /dev/cdrom and it is loaded with an audio CD, you may sim­
       ply  invoke  cdda2wav  and  it  will create the sound file
       audio.wav recording the whole track beginning with track 1
       in  stereo at 16 bit at 44100 Hz sample rate, if your file
       system has enough space free.   Otherwise  recording  time
       will be limited. SCSI drives have to use different devices
       (see files README and README.INSTALL for details).

HINTS ON OPTIONS
       Options
              Most of the options are used to control the  format
              of  the WAV file. In the following text all of them
              are described.

       Select Device
              -D device selects the  CDROM  drive  device  to  be
              used.  The specifier given should correspond to the
              selected interface (see below).  CHANGE!   For  the
              cooked_ioctl  interface  this  is  the cdrom device
              descriptor as before.  The SCSI devices  used  with
              the   generic   SCSI   interface  however  are  now
              addressed with their SCSI-Bus, SCSI-Id,  and  SCSI-
              Lun  instead  of  the  generic SCSI device descrip­
              tor!!!  One example for a SCSI CDROM drive on bus 0
              with SCSI ID 3 and lun 0 is -D0,3,0.

       Select Auxiliary device
              -A  auxdevice  is  necessary for CD-Extra handling.
              For Non-SCSI-CDROM drives this is the  same  device
              as  given  by -D (see above). For SCSI-CDROM drives
              it is the CDROM drive (SCSI) device (i.e.  /dev/sr0
              )  corresponding to the SCSI device (i.e.  0,3,0 ).
              It has to match the device used for sampling.

       Select Interface
              -I interface selects the CDROM drive interface. For
              SCSI  drives use generic_scsi (cooked_ioctl may not
              yet be available for all devices): generic_scsi and
              cooked_ioctl.   The  first  uses  the  generic SCSI
              interface, the latter uses the ioctl of  the  CDROM
              driver. The latter variant works only when the ker­
              nel driver supports CDDA reading. This entry has to
              match the selected CDROM device (see above).

       Enable echo to soundcard
              -e  copies  audio  data  to  the  sound  card while
              recording, so you hear  it  nearly  simultaneously.
              The  soundcard gets the same data that is recorded.
              This is time critical, so it works best with the -q
              option.   To  use  cdda2wav  as  a pseudo CD player
              without recording in a file you could use  cdda2wav
              -q  -e  -t2  -d0 -N to play the whole second track.
              This feature reduces the recording speed to at most
              onefold  speed.  You  cannot make better recordings
              than your sound card can play (since the same  data
              is used).

       Change pitch of echoed audio
              -p percentage changes the pitch of all audio echoed
              to a sound card. Only the copy to the soundcard  is
              affected,  the  recorded  audio  samples  in a file
              remain  the  same.   Normal  pitch,  which  is  the
              default,  is given by 100%.  Lower percentages cor­
              respond to lower pitches, i.e.   -p  50  transposes
              the  audio  output  one octave lower.  See also the
              script pitchplay as an  example.  This  option  was
              contributed by Raul Sobon.

       Select mono or stereo recording
              -m  or  -c  1  selects  mono recording (both stereo
              channels are mixed), -s or -c 2  or  -c  s  selects
              stereo  recording  (doubles file size). Parameter s
              will swap both sound channels.

       Select maximum quality
              -x will set stereo, 16 bits per sample at 44.1  KHz
              (full  CD quality).  Note that other format options
              given later can change this setting.

       Select sample quality
              -b 8 specifies 8 bit (1 Byte) for  each  sample  in
              each  channel;  -b 12 specifies 12 bit (2 Byte) for
              each sample in each channel; -b 16 specifies 16 bit
              (2  Byte)  for  each sample in each channel (Ensure
              that your sample player or sound card is capable of
              playing  12-bit or 16-bit samples). Selecting 12 or
              16 bits doubles  file  size.   12-bit  samples  are
              aligned  to 16-bit samples, so they waste some disk
              space.

       Select sample rate
              -r samplerate selects a  sample  rate.   samplerate
              can  be in a range between 44100 and 900. Option -R
              lists all available rates.

       Select sample rate divider
              -a divider selects a sample rate divider.   divider
              can  be  minimally  1 and maximally 50.5 and every­
              thing between in steps of 0.5.  Option -R lists all
              available rates.

              To make the sound smoother at lower sampling rates,
              cdda2wav sums over n samples (where n is  the  spe­
              cific  dividend). So for 22050 Hertz output we have
              to sum over 2 samples, for 900 Hertz we have to sum
              over  49 samples.  This cancels higher frequencies.
              Standard sector size of an audio CD (ignoring addi­
              tional information) is 2352 Bytes. In order to fin­
              ish summing for an output sample at  sector  bound­
              aries   the   rates   above  have  to  be  choosen.
              Arbitrary sampling  rates  in  high  quality  would
              require some interpolation scheme, which needs much
              more sophisticated programming.

       List a table of all sampling rates
              -R shows a list  of  all  sample  rates  and  their
              dividers.  Dividers  can  range  from  1 to 50.5 in
              steps of 0.5.

       Select start track and optionally end track
              -t n+m selects n as the start track and  optionally
              m  as  the  last  track  of a range to be recorded.
              These tracks must be from the  table  of  contents.
              This sets the track where recording begins. Record­
              ing can advance through  the  following  tracks  as
              well  (limited  by the optional end track or other­
              wise depending on recording time). Whether one file
              or  different files are then created depends on the
              -B option (see below).

       Select start index
              -i n selects the index  to  start  recording  with.
              Indices other than 1 will invoke the index scanner,
              which will take some time to find the correct start
              position.  An offset may be given additionally (see
              below).

       Set recording time
              -d  n sets recording  time  to  n  seconds  or  set
              recording  time  for  whole  track if n is zero. In
              order to specify the duration in  frames  (sectors)
              also,  the  argument can have an appended 'f'. Then
              the numerical argument is to  be  taken  as  frames
              (sectors) rather than seconds.  Please note that if
              track ranges are being used they define the record­
              ing  time  as  well  thus  overriding any -d option
              specified times.

              Recording time is defined as the time the generated
              sample  will  play  (at  the  defined sample rate).
              Since it's related to the amount of generated  sam­
              ples,  it's  not  the  time of the sampling process
              itself (which can be less or more).   It's  neither
              strictly  coupled  with the time information on the
              audio CD (shown by your hifi CD  player).   Differ­
              ences  can occur by the usage of the -o option (see
              below). Notice that recording time will  be  short­
              ened,  unless  enough  disk space exists. Recording
              can be aborted at anytime  by  pressing  the  break
              character (signal SIGQUIT).

       Record a complete audio CD in one go in different files
              -B  copies  each track into a seperate file. A base
              name can be given.  File  names  have  an  appended
              track  number and an extension corresponding to the
              audio format. To record all audio tracks of  a  CD,
              use a sufficient high duration (i.e. -d99999).

       Set start sector offset
              -o  sectors increments start sector of the track by
              sectors.  By this option you are  able  to  skip  a
              certain  amount  at the beginning of a track so you
              can pick exactly the part  you  want.  Each  sector
              runs  for  1/75 seconds, so you have very fine con­
              trol. If your offset is so high that it  would  not
              fit  into  the  current track, a warning message is
              issued and the offset is ignored.   Recording  time
              is  not  reduced.  (To skip introductory quiet pas­
              sages automagically, use the -w option see  below.)

       Wait for signal option
              -w  Turning on this option will suppress all silent
              output at startup,  reducing  possibly  file  size.
              cdda2wav  will  watch  for any signal in the output
              signal and switches on writing to file.

       Find extrem samples
              -F Turning on this option  will  display  the  most
              negative  and  the most positive sample value found
              during recording for both  channels.  This  can  be
              useful for readjusting the volume. The values shown
              are not reset at track boundaries, they  cover  the
              complete  sampling process. They are taken from the
              original samples and have  the  same  format  (i.e.
              they  are  independent  of the selected output for­
              mat).

       Find if input samples are in mono
              -G If this option is given, input samples for  both
              channels  will  be compared. At the end of the pro­
              gram the result  is  printed.  Differences  in  the
              channels indicate stereo, otherwise when both chan­
              nels are equal it will indicate mono.

       Undo the pre-emphasis in the input samples
              -T Some older audio CDs are recorded with  a  modi­
              fied  frequency  response called pre-emphasis. This
              is found mostly in classical recordings.  The  cor­
              rection  can  be  seen in the flags of the Table Of
              Contents often. But there are recordings, that show
              this  setting  only  in  the  subchannels.  If this
              option is given, the index scanner will be started,
              which reads the q-subchannel of each track. If pre-
              emphasis is indicated  in  the  q-subchannel  of  a
              track,  but  not  in  the TOC, pre-emphasis will be
              assumed to be present, and subsequently  a  reverse
              filtering is done for this track before the samples
              are written into the audio file.

       Set audio format
              -O  audiotype can be wav (for wav files) or  au  or
              sun  (for sun PCM files) or cdr or raw (for header­
              less files to be used for cd  writers).   All  file
              samples  are  coded in linear pulse code modulation
              (as done in the audio compact  disc  format).  This
              holds for all audio formats.  Wav files are compat­
              ible to Wind*ws sound files, they have lsb,msb byte
              order  as  being  used on the audio cd. The default
              filename extension is '.wav'.  Sun type  files  are
              not like the older common logarithmically coded .au
              files, but instead as mentioned above linear PCM is
              used.  The  byte order is msb,lsb to be compatible.
              The default filename extension is '.au'.  The  AIFF
              and the newer variant AIFC from the Apple/SGI world
              store their samples in bigendian format  (msb,lsb).
              In  AIFC no compression is used.  Finally the easi­
              est 'format', the cdr aka raw format.  It  is  done
              per  default  in  msb,lsb byte order to satisfy the
              order wanted by most cd writers. Since there is  no
              header  information  in  this  format,  the  sample
              parameters can only be identified  by  playing  the
              samples  on  a  soundcard  or similiar. The default
              filename extension is '.cdr' or '.raw'.

       Select cdrom drive reading speed
              -S  speed allows to switch the  cdrom  drive  to  a
              certain  level  of  speed  in  order to reduce read
              errors. The argument is transfered verbatim to  the
              drive.   Details  depend  very  much  on  the cdrom
              drives.  An argument of 0 for example is often  the
              default  speed  of  the  drive,  a value of 1 often
              selects single speed.

       Enable MD5 checksums
              -M  count enables calculation of MD-5 checksum  for
              'count'  bytes  from the beginning of a track. This
              was introduced for quick comparisons of tracks.

       Do linear or overlapping reading of sectors
              -P  sectors sets the given number  of  sectors  for
              initial overlap sampling for jitter correction. Two
              cases are to be distinguished. For nonzero  values,
              some  sectors  are  read twice to enable cdda2wav's
              jitter correction.   If  an  argument  of  zero  is
              given,  no  overlap  sampling  will  be  used.  For
              nonzero  overlap   sectors   cdda2wav   dynamically
              adjusts  the  setting during sampling (like cdpara­
              noia does).  If no match  can  be  found,  cdda2wav
              retries the read with an increased overlap.  If the
              amount of jitter is lower than  the  current  over­
              lapped  samples,  cdda2wav reduces the overlap set­
              ting, resulting in a  higher  reading  speed.   The
              argument  given has to be lower than the total num­
              ber of sectors per request (see option  -n  below).
              Cdda2wav will check this setting and issues a error
              message otherwise.  The case  of  zero  sectors  is
              nice  on low load situations or errorfree (perfect)
              cdrom drives and perfect (not scratched) audio cds.

       Set the transfer size
              -n  sectors will set the transfer size to the spec­
              ified sectors per request.

       Set number of ring buffer elements
              -l  buffers will allocate the specified  number  of
              ring buffer elements.

       Set endianess of input samples
              -C  endianess will override the default settings of
              the input format.  Endianess can be set  explicitly
              to  "little" or "big" or to the automatic endianess
              detection based on voting with "guess".

       Set endianess of output samples
              -E  endianess (endianess can be "little" or  "big")
              will  override  the  default settings of the output
              format.

       Verbose option
              -v  level prints more information.  A  binary  mask
              allows selection of different information.

              0 keeps quiet

              1 displays the table of contents

              2 displays a summary of recording parameters

              4  invokes  the  index  scanner  and displays start
              positions of indices

              8 retrieves and displays a media catalog number

              16 retrieves and  displays  international  standard
              recording codes

              32  displays track start positions in absolute sec­
              tor notation

              To combine several requests just  add  the  numbers
              and give the sum as argument.

       The table of contents
              The  display  will  show the table of contents with
              number of  tracks  and  total  time  (displayed  in
              mm:ss.hh format, mm=minutes, ss=seconds, hh=rounded
              1/100 seconds).  The following list displays  track
              number  and track time for each entry.  The summary
              gives a line per track describing the type  of  the
              track.

                track preemphasis copypermitted tracktype chans

              The track column holds the track number.  preempha­
              sis shows if that track has been given a non linear
              frequency response.  NOTE: You can undo this effect
              with the -T option.   copy-permitted  indicates  if
              this  track  is  allowed to copy.  tracktype can be
              data or audio. On  multimedia  CDs  (except  hidden
              track  CDs)  both of them should be present.  chan­
              nels is defined for audio tracks only. There can be
              two or four channels.

       No file output
              -N  this debugging option switches off writing to a
              file.

       No infofile generation
              -H this option switches off  creation  of  an  info
              file and a cddb file.

       Generation of simple output for gui frontends
              -g  this option switches on simple line formatting,
              which is needed to support gui frontends (like xcd-
              roast).

       Verbose SCSI logging
              -V  this  option  switches  on logging of SCSI com­
              mands. This will produce a lot of output (when SCSI
              devices are being used), which is needed for debug­
              ging purposes. The format is the same as being used
              with  the  cdrecord package from Jörg Schilling.  I
              will not describe it here.

       Quiet option
              -q suppresses all screen output except  error  mes­
              sages.  That reduces cpu time resources.

       Just show information option
              -J  does  not write a file, it only prints informa­
              tion about the disc (depending on the  -v  option).
              This is just for information purposes.

       Lookup album and track titles option
              -L  Cdda2wav  tries  to retrieve performer, album-,
              and track titles from a cddbp server.  The  default
              server  right  now  is  'freedb.freedb.org'.  It is
              planned to have more control over the  server  han­
              dling later.

HINTS ON USAGE
       Don't  create  samples  you  cannot read. First check your
       sample player software and sound card hardware. I  experi­
       enced  problems with very low sample rates (stereo <= 1575
       Hz, mono <= 3675 Hz) when trying to play them  with  stan­
       dard  WAV  players  for  sound blaster (maybe they are not
       legal in WAV format). Most CD-Writers insist on audio sam­
       ples  in a bigendian format.  Now cdda2wav supports the -E
       endianess option to control the endianess of  the  written
       samples.

       If  your  hardware is fast enough to run cdda2wav uninter­
       rupted and your CD drive is one of the 'perfect' ones, you
       will  gain  speed  when switching all overlap sampling off
       with the -P  0 option. Further fine  tuning  can  be  done
       with the -n  sectors option. You can specify how much sec­
       tors should be requested in one go.

       Cdda2wav supports pipes now. Use a filename of  -  to  let
       cdda2wav output its samples to standard output.

       Conversion  to  other  sound formats can be done using the
       sox program package (although the use of sox -x to  change
       the byte order of samples should be no more necessary; see
       option -E to change the output byteorder).

       If you really want to sample more than one track into dif­
       ferent  files  in one run, this is currently possible with
       the -B option. When recording time exceeds the track limit
       a new file will be opened for the next track.

FILES
       Cdda2wav can generate a lot of files for various purposes.

       Audio files:

       There are audio  files  containing  samples  with  default
       extensions  These files are not generated when option (-N)
       is given. Multiple files may be written when the bulk copy
       option (-B) is used. Individual file names can be given as
       arguments. If the number of file names given is sufficient
       to cover all included audio tracks, the file names will be
       used verbatim.  Otherwise, if there are  less  file  names
       than  files  needed to write the included tracks, the part
       of the file name before the  extension  is  extended  with
       '_dd' where dd represents the current track number.

       Cddb and Cdindex files:

       If  cdda2wav  detects  cd-extra  or  cd-text (album/track)
       title information, then .cddb and .cdindex files are  gen­
       erated  unless  suppressed  by the option -H. They contain
       suitable formatted entries  for  submission  to  audio  cd
       track  title  databases  in  the internet. The CDINDEX and
       CDDB(tm) systems are currently supported. For more  infor­
       mation please visit www.cdindex.org and www.cddb.com.

       Inf files:

       The inf files are describing the sample files and the part
       from the audio cd, it was taken from. They are a means  to
       transfer   information   to  a  cd  burning  program  like
       cdrecord. For example, if the original audio cd  had  pre-
       emphasis  enabled,  and  cdda2wav  -T  did remove the pre-
       emphase, then the inf file has pre-emphasis not set (since
       the  audio file does not have it anymore), while the .cddb
       and the .cdindex have  pre-emphase  set  as  the  original
       does.

WARNING
       IMPORTANT:  it is prohibited to sell copies of copyrighted
       material by noncopyright holders. This program may not  be
       used to circumvent copyrights.  The user acknowledges this
       constraint when using the software.

BUGS
       Performance may not be optimal on slower systems.

       The index scanner may give timeouts.

       The resampling  (rate  conversion  code)  uses  polynomial
       interpolation, which is not optimal.

       Cdda2wav should use threads.

       Cdda2wav  currently  cannot  sample  hidden  audio  tracks
       (track 1 index 0).
