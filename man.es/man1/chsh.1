CHSH(1)               Linux Reference Manual              CHSH(1)



NAME
       chsh - change your login shell

SYNOPSIS
       chsh [ -s shell ] [ -l ] [ -u ] [ -v ] [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
       chsh  is  used  to change your login shell.  If a shell is
       not given on the command line, chsh prompts for one.

   VALID SHELLS
       chsh will accept the full pathname of any executable  file
       on  the  system.   However, it will issue a warning if the
       shell is not listed in the /etc/shells file.  On the other
       hand,  it  can  also  be configured such that it will only
       accept shells listed in this file, unless you are root.

OPTIONS
       -s, --shell
              Specify your login shell.

       -l, --list-shells
              Print the list of shells listed in /etc/shells  and
              exit.

       -u, --help
              Print a usage message and exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version information and exit.
