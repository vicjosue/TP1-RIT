NAME
       ppmspread  - displace a portable pixmap's pixels by a ran­
       dom amount

SYNOPSIS
       ppmspread amount [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input. Moves every pixel around
       a bit relative to its original position. amount determines
       by how many pixels a pixel is to be moved around at  most.

       Pictures  processed with this filter will seem to be some­
       what dissolved or unfocussed (although  they  appear  more
       coarse  than  images processed by something like pnmconvol
       ).

SEE ALSO
       ppm(5), pnmconvol(1)
