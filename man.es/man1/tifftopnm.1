NAME
       tifftopnm - convert a TIFF file into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       tifftopnm  [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]  [--headerdump]
       [tiff-filename]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a TIFF file as input.  Produces a portable anymap as
       output.   The type of the output file depends on the input
       file - if it's black & white, generates  a  pbm  file;  if
       it's  grayscale,  generates  a  pgm file; otherwise, a ppm
       file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

       This program cannot read every possible TIFF file -- there
       are  myriad  variations  of  the TIFF format.  However, it
       does understand  monochrome  and  gray  scale,  RGB,  RGBA
       (red/green/blue  with  alpha channel), CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-
       Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color palette TIFF
       files.   An  RGB file can have either single plane (inter­
       leaved) color or multiple plane format.  The program reads
       1-8  and  16  bit-per-sample  input,  the latter in either
       bigendian or littlendian encoding.  Tiff directory  infor­
       mation may also be either bigendian or littendian.

       One  reason this program isn't as general as TIFF programs
       often are is that it does not use  the  TIFFRGBAImageGet()
       function  of the TIFF library to read TIFF files.  Rather,
       it uses the more primitive TIFFReadScanLine() function and
       decodes it itself.

       There is no fundamental reason that this program could not
       read other kinds of TIFF files; the  existing  limitations
       are mainly because no one has asked for more.

       The  PNM  output  has  the  same maxval as the Tiff input,
       except that  if  the  Tiff  input  is  colormapped  (which
       implies  a maxval of 65535) the PNM output has a maxval of
       255.  Though this may result  in  lost  information,  such
       input  images hardly ever actually have more color resolu­
       tion than a maxval of 255 provides and people often cannot
       deal  with PNM files that have maxval > 255.  By contrast,
       a non-colormapped Tiff image that doesn't need a maxval  >
       255 doesn't have a maxval > 255, so when we see a non-col­
       ormapped maxval > 255, we take it seriously and produce  a
       matching output maxval.

       The  tiff-filename  argument  names  the regular file that
       contains the Tiff image.  If  you  specify  "-"  or  don't
       specify  this  argument,  tfftopnm uses Standard Input. In
       either case, the file must be  seekable.   That  means  no
       pipe, but any regular file is fine.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              tifftopnm  creates  a  PGM  (portable graymap) file
              containing the alpha channel values  in  the  input
              image.  If the input image doesn't contain an alpha
              channel, the alpha-filename file contains all  zero
              (transparent)  alpha  values.  If you don't specify
              --alphaout, tifftopnm does not  generate  an  alpha
              file,  and if the input image has an alpha channel,
              tifftopnm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, tifftopnm  writes
              the  alpha  output  to Standard Output and discards
              the image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha  output
              file.

       --headerdump
              Dump  TIFF file information to stderr.  This infor­
              mation may be useful in debugging TIFF file conver­
              sion problems.

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique
       prefix.
