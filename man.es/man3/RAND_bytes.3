       RAND_bytes() puts nnuumm cryptographically strong pseudo-
       random bytes into bbuuff. An error occurs if the PRNG has not
       been seeded with enough randomness to ensure an
       unpredictable byte sequence.

       RAND_pseudo_bytes() puts nnuumm pseudo-random bytes into bbuuff.
       Pseudo-random byte sequences generated by
       RAND_pseudo_bytes() will be unique if they are of
       sufficient length, but are not necessarily unpredictable.
       They can be used for non-cryptographic purposes and for
       certain purposes in cryptographic protocols, but usually
       not for key generation etc.

       RAND_bytes() returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise. The error
       code can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).
       RAND_pseudo_bytes() returns 1 if the bytes generated are
       cryptographically strong, 0 otherwise. Both functions
       return -1 if they are not supported by the current RAND
       method.

       RAND_bytes() is available in all versions of SSLeay and
       OpenSSL.  It has a return value since OpenSSL 0.9.5.
       RAND_pseudo_bytes() was added in OpenSSL 0.9.5.
