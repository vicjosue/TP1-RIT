       OpenSSL keeps an internal table of digest algorithms and
       ciphers. It uses this table to lookup ciphers via
       functions such as EVP_get_cipher_byname().

       OpenSSL_add_all_digests() adds all digest algorithms to
       the table.

       OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() adds all algorithms to the
       table (digests and ciphers).

       OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers() adds all encryption algorithms
       to the table including password based encryption
       algorithms.

       EVP_cleanup() removes all ciphers and digests from the
       table.

       A typical application will will call
       OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() initially and EVP_cleanup()
       before exiting.

       An application does not need to add algorithms to use them
       explicitly, for example by EVP_sha1(). It just needs to
       add them if it (or any of the functions it calls) needs to
       lookup algorithms.

       The cipher and digest lookup functions are used in many
       parts of the library. If the table is not initialized
       several functions will misbehave and complain they cannot
       find algorithms. This includes the PEM, PKCS#12, SSL and
       S/MIME libraries.  This is a common query in the OpenSSL
       mailing lists.

       Calling OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() links in all
       algorithms: as a result a statically linked executable can
       be quite large. If this is important it is possible to
       just add the required ciphers and digests.

       Although the functions do not return error codes it is
       possible for them to fail.  This will only happen as a
       result of a memory allocation failure so this is not too
       much of a problem in practice.
