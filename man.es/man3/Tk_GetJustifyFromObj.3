DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetJustifyFromObj  places  in  *justifyPtr  the justify |
       value corresponding to objPtr's value.  This value will be
       one of the following:

       TK_JUSTIFY_LEFT
              Means  that  the  text on each line should start at
              the left edge of the line;  as a result, the  right
              edges of lines may be ragged.

       TK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT
              Means  that the text on each line should end at the
              right edge of the line;   as  a  result,  the  left
              edges of lines may be ragged.

       TK_JUSTIFY_CENTER
              Means  that  the  text  on each line should be cen­
              tered;  as a result, both the left and right  edges
              of lines may be ragged.

       Under  normal circumstances the return value is TCL_OK and |
       interp is unused.  If objPtr doesn't contain a valid  jus­ |
       tification style or an abbreviation of one of these names, |
       TCL_ERROR is returned, *justifyPtr is unmodified,  and  an |
       error message is stored in interp's result if interp isn't |
       NULL.  Tk_GetJustifyFromObj caches information  about  the |
       return  value  in  objPtr, which speeds up future calls to |
       Tk_GetJustifyFromObj with the same objPtr.                 |

       Tk_GetJustify is identical to Tk_GetJustifyFromObj  except |
       that  the  description  of  the justification is specified |
       with  a  string  instead  of  an  object.   This  prevents |
       Tk_GetJustify from caching the return value, so Tk_GetJus­ |
       tify is less efficient than Tk_GetJustifyFromObj.

       Tk_NameOfJustify is the logical inverse of  Tk_GetJustify.
       Given  a  justify  value it returns a statically-allocated
       string corresponding to justify.  If justify isn't a legal
       justify  value,  then  ``unknown  justification style'' is
       returned.
