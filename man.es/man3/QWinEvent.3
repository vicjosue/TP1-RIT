DESCRIPTION
       This procedure places a window  event  on  Tcl's  internal
       event   queue   for  eventual  servicing.   It  creates  a
       Tcl_Event structure, copies the event into that structure,
       and  calls  Tcl_QueueEvent  to add the event to the queue.
       When the event is eventually removed from the queue it  is
       processed just like all window events.

       The  position argument to Tk_QueueWindowEvent has the same
       significance as for Tcl_QueueEvent;  see the documentation
       for Tcl_QueueEvent for details.
