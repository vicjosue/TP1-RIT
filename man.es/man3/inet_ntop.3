NAME
       inet_ntop - Parse network address structures

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <arpa/inet.h>

       const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *src,
                             char *dst, size_t cnt);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  converts the network address structure src
       in the af address family into a character string, which is
       copied to a character buffer dst, which is cnt bytes long.

       inet_ntop(3) extends the inet_ntoa(3) function to  support
       multiple  address families, inet_ntoa(3) is now considered
       to be deprecated in favor of inet_ntop(3).  The  following
       address families are currently supported:

       AF_INET
              src  points to a struct in_addr (network byte order
              format) which  is  converted  to  an  IPv4  network
              address      in     the     dotted-quad     format,
              "ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd".  The buffer dst must be at least
              INET_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.

       AF_INET6
              src points to a struct in6_addr (network byte order
              format) which is converted to a  representation  of
              this  address  in the most appropriate IPv6 network
              address format for this address.   The  buffer  dst
              must be at least INET6_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.

RETURN VALUE
       inet_ntop  returns  a  non-null  pointer  to dst.  NULL is
       returned if there was an error, with errno set  to  EAFNO­
       SUPPORT if af was not set to a valid address family, or to
       ENOSPC if the converted address string  would  exceed  the
       size of dst given by the cnt argument.

BUGS
       AF_INET6  converts IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses into an IPv6
       format.
