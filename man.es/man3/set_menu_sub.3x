NAME
       menu_win  - make and break menu window and subwindow asso­
       ciations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <menu.h>
       int set_menu_win(MENU *menu, WINDOW *win);
       WINDOW *menu_win(const MENU *menu);
       int set_menu_sub(MENU *menu, WINDOW *sub);
       WINDOW *menu_sub(const MENU *menu);
       int scale_menu(const MENU *menu, int *rows, int *columns);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  menu has an associated pair of curses windows.  The
       menu window displays any title and border associated  with
       the  window;  the menu subwindow displays the items of the
       menu that are currently available for selection.

       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is
       not necessary to set either window; by default, the driver
       code uses stdscr for both.

       In the set_ functions, window argument of NULL is  treated
       as  though  it  were  stsdcr.   A menu argument of NULL is
       treated as a request to change  the  system  default  menu
       window or subwindow.

       The  function scale_menu returns the minimum size required
       for the subwindow of menu.

RETURN VALUE
       Routines that return pointers return NULL on error.   Rou­
       tines  that  return an integer return one of the following
       error codes:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno).

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
            Routine detected an incorrect or  out-of-range  argu­
            ment.

       E_POSTED
            The menu has already been posted.

       E_NOT_CONNECTED
            No items are connected to the menu.

       curses(3X), menu(3X).

NOTES
       The header file <menu.h> automatically includes the header
       file <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V  menu  library.   They
       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
