DESCRIPTION
       This procedure delays the calling process by the number of
       milliseconds  given  by the ms parameter and returns after
       that time has elapsed.  It is typically  used  for  things
       like  flashing  a button, where the delay is short and the
       application needn't  do  anything  while  it  waits.   For
       longer  delays  where  the application needs to respond to
       other events during the delay, the  procedure  Tcl_Create­
       TimerHandler should be used instead of Tcl_Sleep.


KEYWORDS
       sleep, time, wait
