NAME
       Tk_GeometryRequest, Tk_SetInternalBorder - specify desired
       geometry or internal border for a window

SYNOPSIS

       Tk_GeometryRequest(tkwin, reqWidth, reqHeight)

       Tk_SetInternalBorder(tkwin, width)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window    tkwin        (in)      Window for which geom­
                                           etry      is     being
                                           requested.

       int          reqWidth     (in)      Desired   width    for
                                           tkwin, in pixel units.

       int          reqHeight    (in)      Desired   height   for
                                           tkwin, in pixel units.

       int          width        (in)      Space  to  leave   for
                                           internal   border  for

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GeometryRequest  is  called  by widget code to indicate
       its preference for the dimensions of a particular  window.
       The  arguments to Tk_GeometryRequest are made available to
       the geometry manager for the window, which then decides on
       the  actual  geometry  for  the window.  Although geometry
       managers  generally  try  to  satisfy  requests  made   to
       Tk_GeometryRequest,  there  is no guarantee that this will
       always be possible.  Widget code should not assume that  a
       geometry  request  will  be  satisfied until it receives a
       ConfigureNotify event indicating that the geometry  change
       has  occurred.   Widget  code should never call procedures
       like Tk_ResizeWindow directly.  Instead, it should  invoke
       Tk_GeometryRequest  and leave the final geometry decisions
       to the geometry manager.

       If tkwin is a top-level window, then the geometry informa­
       tion  will be passed to the window manager using the stan­
       dard ICCCM protocol.

       Tk_SetInternalBorder is called by widget code to  indicate
       that  the  widget has an internal border.  This means that
       the widget draws a decorative  border  inside  the  window
       instead  of using the standard X borders, which are exter­
       nal to the window's area.  For example,  internal  borders
       are  used  to draw 3-D effects.  Width specifies the width
       of the border in pixels.  Geometry managers will use  this
       information  to  avoid placing any children of tkwin over­
       lapping the outermost width pixels of tkwin's area.

       The information specified in calls  to  Tk_GeometryRequest
       and Tk_SetInternalBorder can be retrieved using the macros
       Tk_ReqWidth,  Tk_ReqHeight,  and   Tk_InternalBorderWidth.
       See the Tk_WindowId manual entry for details.
