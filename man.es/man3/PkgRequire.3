DESCRIPTION
       These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's pack­
       age and version management facilities.

       Tcl_PkgRequire  is  equivalent to the package require com­
       mand, Tcl_PkgPresent is equivalent to the package  present
       command,  and  Tcl_PkgProvide is equivalent to the package
       provide command.

       See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details  on
       what these procedures do.

       If  Tcl_PkgPresent or Tcl_PkgRequire complete successfully
       they return a pointer to the version string for  the  ver­
       sion  of  the  package that is provided in the interpreter
       (which may be different than version); if an error  occurs
       they  return NULL and leave an error message in the inter­
       preter's result.

       Tcl_PkgProvide returns TCL_OK  if  it  completes  success­
       fully;  if an error occurs it returns TCL_ERROR and leaves
       an error message in the interpreter's result.

       Tcl_PkgProvideEx,  Tcl_PkgPresentEx  and  Tcl_PkgRequireEx
       allow  the setting and retrieving of the client data asso­
       ciated with the package. In all other  respects  they  are
       equivalent to the matching functions.
