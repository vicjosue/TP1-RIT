DESCRIPTION
       This procedure is invoked to retrieve an option  from  the
       database associated with tkwin's main window.  If there is
       an option for tkwin that matches the given name or  class,
       then  it is returned in the form of a Tk_Uid.  If multiple
       options match name and class,  then  the  highest-priority
       one  is  returned.   If  no  option  matches, then NULL is
       returned.

       Tk_GetOption caches options related to tkwin so that  suc­
       cessive  calls  for  the same tkwin will execute much more
       quickly than successive calls for different windows.
