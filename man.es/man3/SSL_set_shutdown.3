       SSL_set_shutdown() sets the shutdown state of ssssll to mmooddee.

       SSL_get_shutdown() returns the shutdown mode of ssssll.

       The shutdown state of an ssl connection is a bitmask of:

       0   No shutdown setting, yet.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN
           A "close notify" shutdown alert was sent to the peer,
           the connection is being considered closed and the
           session is closed and correct.

       SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN
           A shutdown alert was received form the peer, either a
           normal "close notify" or a fatal error.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN and SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN can be set at
       the same time.

       The shutdown state of the connection is used to determine
       the state of the ssl session. If the session is still
       open, when SSL_clear(3) or SSL_free(3) is called, it is
       considered bad and removed according to RFC2246.  The
       actual condition for a correctly closed session is
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN (according to the TLS RFC, it is
       acceptable to only send the "close notify" alert but to
       not wait for the peer's answer, when the underlying
       connection is closed).  SSL_set_shutdown() can be used to
       set this state without sending a close alert to the peer
       (see SSL_shutdown(3)).

       If a "close notify" was received, SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN
       will be set, for setting SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN the application
       must however still call SSL_shutdown(3) or
       SSL_set_shutdown() itself.

       SSL_set_shutdown() does not return diagnostic information.

       SSL_get_shutdown() returns the current setting.
