       SSL_get_verify_result() returns the result of the
       verification of the X509 certificate presented by the
       peer, if any.

NNOOTTEESS
       SSL_get_verify_result() can only return one error code
       while the verification of a certificate can fail because
       of many reasons at the same time. Only the last
       verification error that occurred during the processing is
       available from SSL_get_verify_result().

       The verification result is part of the established session
       and is restored when a session is reused.

BBUUGGSS
       If no peer certificate was presented, the returned result
       code is X509_V_OK. This is because no verification error
       occurred, it does however not indicate success.
       SSL_get_verify_result() is only useful in connection with
       SSL_get_peer_certificate(3).

       The following return values can currently occur:

       X509_V_OK
           The verification succeeded or no peer certificate was
           presented.

       Any other value
           Documented in verify(1).
