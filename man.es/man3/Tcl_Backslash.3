NAME
       Tcl_Backslash - parse a backslash sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       char
       Tcl_Backslash(src, countPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       char   *src        (in)      Pointer  to a string starting
                                    with a backslash.

       int    *countPtr   (out)     If   countPtr   isn't   NULL,
                                    *countPtr gets filled in with
                                    number of characters  in  the
                                    backslash sequence, including
                                    the backslash character.

DESCRIPTION
       The  use  of  Tcl_Backslash  is  deprecated  in  favor  of |
       Tcl_UtfBackslash.                                          |

       This is a utility procedure provided for backwards compat­ |
       ibilty  with  non-internationalized  Tcl  extensions.   It |
       parses  a  backslash  sequence and returns the low byte of |
       the  Unicode  character  corresponding  to  the  sequence.
       Tcl_Backslash  modifies *countPtr to contain the number of
       characters in the backslash sequence.

       See the Tcl manual entry  for  information  on  the  valid
       backslash  sequences.   All  of the sequences described in
       the Tcl manual entry are supported by Tcl_Backslash.
