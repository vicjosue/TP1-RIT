keyok(3X)                                               keyok(3X)



NAME
       keyok - enable or disable a keycode

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int keyok(int keycode, bool enable);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to disable specific keycodes, rather than  use
       the  keypad  function  to disable all keycodes.  Keys that
       have been disabled can be reenabled.

RETURN VALUE
       The keycode  must  be  greater  than  zero,  else  ERR  is
       returned.   If  it  does  not correspond to a defined key,
       then ERR is returned.  If the enable  parameter  is  true,
       then  the  key  must  have  been disabled, and vice versa.
       Otherwise, the function returns OK.

PORTABILITY
       These routines are specific to  ncurses.   They  were  not
       supported  on  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
       It is recommended that any code depending on them be  con­
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
