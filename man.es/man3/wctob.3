NAME
       wctob - try to represent a wide character as a single byte

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wctob(wint_t c);

DESCRIPTION
       The wctob function tests whether the multi-byte  represen­
       tation  of  the  wide character c, starting in the initial
       state, consists of a single byte. If so, it is returned as
       an unsigned char.

       Never  use  this  function.  It cannot help you in writing
       internationalized  programs.  Internationalized   programs
       must  never distinguish single-byte and multi-byte charac­
       ters.

RETURN VALUE
       The wctob function returns the single-byte  representation
       of c, if it exists, of EOF otherwise.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

SEE ALSO
       wctomb(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of wctob depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
       the current locale.

       This function should never be used. Internationalized pro­
       grams  must  never  distinguish single-byte and multi-byte
       characters. Use the function wctomb instead.
