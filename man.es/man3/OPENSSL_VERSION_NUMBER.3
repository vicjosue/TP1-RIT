       OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is a numeric release version
       identifier:

        MMNNFFPPS: major minor fix patch status

       The status nibble has one of the values 0 for development,
       1 to e for betas 1 to 14, and f for release.

       for example

        0x000906000 == 0.9.6 dev
        0x000906023 == 0.9.6b beta 3
        0x00090605f == 0.9.6e release

       Versions prior to 0.9.3 have identifiers < 0x0930.
       Versions between 0.9.3 and 0.9.5 had a version identifier
       with this interpretation:

        MMNNFFRBB major minor fix final beta/patch

       for example

        0x000904100 == 0.9.4 release
        0x000905000 == 0.9.5 dev

       Version 0.9.5a had an interim interpretation that is like
       the current one, except the patch level got the highest
       bit set, to keep continuity.  The number was therefore
       0x0090581f.

       For backward compatibility, SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER is also
       defined.

       SSLeay() returns this number. The return value can be
       compared to the macro to make sure that the correct
       version of the library has been loaded, especially when
       using DLLs on Windows systems.

       SSLeay_version() returns different strings depending on tt:

       SSLEAY_VERSION The text variant of the version number and
       the release date.  For example, """"OpenSSL 0.9.5a 1 Apr
       2000"""".

       SSLEAY_CFLAGS The flags given to the C compiler when
       compiling OpenSSL are returned in a string.



       SSLEAY_PLATFORM The platform name used when OpenSSL was
       configured is returned.

       If the data request isn't available, a text saying that
       the information is not available is returned.

       For an unknown tt, the text "not available" is returned.

       SSLeay() and SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER are available in all
       versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is
       available in all versions of OpenSSL.
