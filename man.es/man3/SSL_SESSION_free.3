       SSL_SESSION_free() decrements the reference count of
       sseessssiioonn and removes the SSSSLL_SSEESSSSIIOONN structure pointed to
       by sseessssiioonn and frees up the allocated memory, if the the
       reference count has reached 0.

       SSL_SESSION objects are allocated, when a TLS/SSL
       handshake operation is successfully completed. Depending
       on the settings, see SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(3),
       the SSL_SESSION objects are internally referenced by the
       SSL_CTX and linked into its session cache. SSL objects may
       be using the SSL_SESSION object; as a session may be
       reused, several SSL objects may be using one SSL_SESSION
       object at the same time. It is therefore crucial to keep
       the reference count (usage information) correct and not
       delete a SSL_SESSION object that is still used, as this
       may lead to program failures due to dangling pointers.
       These failures may also appear delayed, e.g.  when an
       SSL_SESSION object was completely freed as the reference
       count incorrectly became 0, but it is still referenced in
       the internal session cache and the cache list is processed
       during a SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3) operation.

       SSL_SESSION_free() must only be called for SSL_SESSION
       objects, for which the reference count was explicitly
       incremented (e.g.  by calling SSL_get1_session(), see
       SSL_get_session(3)) or when the SSL_SESSION object was
       generated outside a TLS handshake operation, e.g. by using
       d2i_SSL_SESSION(3).  It must not be called on other
       SSL_SESSION objects, as this would cause incorrect
       reference counts and therefore program failures.
