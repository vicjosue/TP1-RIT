NAME
       wcsspn  - advance in a wide-character string, skipping any
       of a set of wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wcsspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *accept);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsspn function is the  wide-character  equivalent  of
       the  strspn  function.  It  determines  the  length of the
       longest initial segment of wcs which consists entirely  of
       wide-characters  listed  in  accept.  In  other  words, it
       searches for the first occurrence  in  the  wide-character
       string  wcs of a wide-character not contained in the wide-
       character string accept.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcsspn function returns the number of wide  characters
       in  the  longest  initial  segment  of  wcs which consists
       entirely of wide-characters listed  in  accept.  In  other
       words,  it returns the position of the first occurrence in
       the wide-character string wcs of a wide-character not con­
       tained in the wide-character string accept, or wcslen(wcs)
       if there is none.
