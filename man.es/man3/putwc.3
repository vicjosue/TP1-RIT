FPUTWC(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           FPUTWC(3)



NAME
       fputwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);
       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc  function  is the wide-character equivalent of
       the fputc function. It writes the  wide  character  wc  to
       stream.  If  ferror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.
       If a wide character conversion error occurs, it sets errno
       to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Otherwise it returns wc.

       The  putwc  function  or  macro  functions  identically to
       fputwc.  It may be implemented as a macro, and may  evalu­
       ate  its  argument more than once. There is no reason ever
       to use it.

       For non-locking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputwc function returns wc if no  error  occurred,  or
       WEOF to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ Conversion of wc to the stream's encoding fails.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

NOTES
       The  behaviour  of fputwc depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional  information  passed  to  the
       fopen  call,  it  is reasonable to expect that fputwc will
       actually write the multibyte sequence corresponding to the
       wide character wc.
