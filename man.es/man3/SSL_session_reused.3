       Query, whether a reused session was negotiated during the
       handshake.

NNOOTTEESS
       During the negotiation, a client can propose to reuse a
       session. The server then looks up the session in its
       cache. If both client and server agree on the session, it
       will be reused and a flag is being set that can be queried
       by the application.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       The following return values can occur:

       0   A new session was negotiated.

       1   A session was reused.
