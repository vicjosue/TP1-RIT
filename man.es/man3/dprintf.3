DPRINTF(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          DPRINTF(3)



NAME
       dprintf, vdprintf - print to a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include <stdio.h>

       int dprintf(int fd, const char *format, ...);

       int vdprintf(int fd, const char *format, va_list ap);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions dprintf and vdprintf (as found in the glibc2
       library) are exact  analogues  of  fprintf  and  vfprintf,
       except that they output to a file descriptor fd instead of
       to a given stream.

NOTES
       These functions are GNU extensions, not  in  C  or  POSIX.
       Clearly,  the names were badly chosen.  Many systems (like
       MacOS) have incompatible functions called dprintf, usually
       some debugging version of printf, perhaps with a prototype
       like

       void dprintf (int level, const char *format, ...);

       where the first parameter is a debugging level (and output
       is  to  stderr).  Moreover, dprintf (or DPRINTF) is also a
       popular macro name for a debugging printf.  So,  probably,
       it  is  better to avoid this function in programs intended
       to be portable.

       A better name would have been fdprintf.
