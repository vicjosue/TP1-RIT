NAME
       Tk_GetJoinStyle,  Tk_NameOfJoinStyle  -  translate between
       strings and join styles

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       int
       Tk_GetJoinStyle(interp, string, joinPtr)

       char *
       Tk_NameOfJoinStyle(join)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp   *interp    (in)      Interpreter to  use  for

       char         *string    (in)      String  containing  name
                                         of join  style:  one  of
                                         ``bevel'', ``miter'', or
                                         ``round''.

       int          *joinPtr   (out)     Pointer to  location  in
                                         which  to  store  X join
                                         style  corresponding  to

       int          join       (in)      Join style: one of Join­

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetJoinStyle places in *joinPtr the X join style corre­
       sponding to string, which will be one of JoinBevel,  Join­
       Miter,  or JoinRound.  Join styles are typically used in X
       graphics contexts to indicate how adjacent  line  segments
       should  be  joined  together.  See the X documentation for
       information on what each style implies.

       Under normal circumstances the return value is TCL_OK  and
       interp  is unused.  If string doesn't contain a valid join
       style or an abbreviation of one of these  names,  then  an
       error  message  is  stored in interp->result, TCL_ERROR is
       returned, and *joinPtr is unmodified.

       Tk_NameOfJoinStyle is the logical inverse  of  Tk_GetJoin­
       Style.   Given a join style such as JoinBevel it returns a
       statically-allocated string  corresponding  to  join.   If
       join isn't a legal join style, then ``unknown join style''
       is returned.
