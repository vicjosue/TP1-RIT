FGETWC(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           FGETWC(3)



NAME
       fgetwc, getwc - read a wide character from a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fgetwc(FILE *stream);
       wint_t getwc(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetwc  function  is the wide-character equivalent of
       the fgetc function. It reads a wide character from  stream
       and  returns  it.  If  the end of stream is reached, or if
       ferror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If  a  wide
       character conversion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ
       and returns WEOF.

       The getwc  function  or  macro  functions  identically  to
       fgetwc.   It may be implemented as a macro, and may evalu­
       ate its argument more than once. There is no  reason  ever
       to use it.

       For non-locking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  fgetwc  function returns the next wide-character from
       the stream, or WEOF.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ The data obtained from the input  stream  does  not
              form a valid character.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

NOTES
       The  behaviour  of fgetwc depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional  information  passed  to  the
       fopen  call,  it  is reasonable to expect that fgetwc will
       actually read a multibyte sequence  from  the  stream  and
       then convert it to a wide character.
