       BIO_set_callback() and BIO_get_callback() set and retrieve
       the BIO callback, they are both macros. The callback is
       called during most high level BIO operations. It can be
       used for debugging purposes to trace operations on a BIO
       or to modify its operation.

       BIO_set_callback_arg() and BIO_get_callback_arg() are
       macros which can be used to set and retrieve an argument
       for use in the callback.

       BIO_debug_callback() is a standard debugging callback
       which prints out information relating to each BIO
       operation. If the callback argument is set if is
       interpreted as a BIO to send the information to, otherwise
       stderr is used.

       callback() is the callback function itself. The meaning of
       each argument is described below.

       The BIO the callback is attached to is passed in bb.

       ooppeerr is set to the operation being performed. For some
       operations the callback is called twice, once before and
       once after the actual operation, the latter case has ooppeerr
       or'ed with BIO_CB_RETURN.

       The meaning of the arguments aarrggpp, aarrggii and aarrggll depends
       on the value of ooppeerr, that is the operation being
       performed.

       rreettvvaalluuee is the return value that would be returned to the
       application if no callback were present. The actual value
       returned is the return value of the callback itself. In
       the case of callbacks called before the actual BIO
       operation 1 is placed in retvalue, if the return value is
       not positive it will be immediately returned to the
       application and the BIO operation will not be performed.

       The callback should normally simply return rreettvvaalluuee when
       it has finished processing, unless if specifically wishes
       to modify the value returned to the application.

       The BIO_debug_callback() function is a good example, its
       source is in crypto/bio/bio_cb.c
