ARGUMENTS
       int         rootX   (in)      X-coordinate (in root window
                                     coordinates).

       int         rootY   (in)      Y-coordinate (in root window
                                     coordinates).

       Tk_Window   tkwin   (in)      Token  for window that iden­

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_CoordsToWindow locates the window that contains a given
       point.   The  point  is specified in root coordinates with
       rootX and rootY (if a virtual-root window  manager  is  in
       use  then  rootX and rootY are in the coordinate system of
       the virtual root window).  The return value from the  pro­
       cedure  is  a token for the window that contains the given
       point.  If the point is not in any window, or if the  con­
       taining  window  is  not in the same application as tkwin,
       then NULL is returned.

       The containing window is decided using the same rules that
       determine  which  window  contains the mouse cursor:  if a
       parent and a child both contain the point then  the  child
       gets  preference,  and  if  two  siblings both contain the
       point then the highest one in the stacking order (i.e. the
       one that's visible on the screen) gets preference.
