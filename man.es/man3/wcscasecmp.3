NAME
       wcscasecmp  - compare two wide-character strings, ignoring
       case

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscasecmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscasecmp function is the  wide-character  equivalent
       of the strcasecmp function. It compares the wide-character
       string pointed to by  s1  and  the  wide-character  string
       pointed  to  by  s2,  ignoring case differences (towupper,
       towlower).

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscasecmp function returns zero if the wide-character
       strings  at  s1  and s2 are equal except for case distinc­
       tions. It returns a positive integer if s1 is greater than
       s2,  ignoring case. It returns a negative integer if s1 is
       smaller than s2, ignoring case.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

SEE ALSO
       strcasecmp(3), wcscmp(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of wcscasecmp depends on the LC_CTYPE  cate­
       gory of the current locale.
