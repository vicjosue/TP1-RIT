NL_LANGINFO(3)      Linux Programmer's Manual      NL_LANGINFO(3)



NAME
       nl_langinfo - query language and locale information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <langinfo.h>

       char *nl_langinfo(nl_item *item);

DESCRIPTION
       The  nl_langinfo function provides access to locale infor­
       mation in a more flexible  way  than  localeconv(3)  does.
       Individual  and  additional  elements  of the locale cate­
       gories can be queried.

       Examples for the locale elements that can be specified  in
       item using the constants defined in <langinfo.h> are:


       CODESET (LC_CTYPE)
              Return  a  string  with  the  name of the character
              encoding used  in  the  selected  locale,  such  as
              "UTF-8",  "ISO-8859-1", or "ANSI_X3.4-1968" (better
              known as US-ASCII). This is the  same  string  that
              you  get with "locale charmap". For a list of char­
              acter  encoding  names,  try   "locale   -m",   cf.
              locale(1).


       D_T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string
              for strftime(3) to represent time  and  date  in  a
              locale-specific way.


       D_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string
              for strftime(3) to represent a date  in  a  locale-
              specific way.


       T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string
              for strftime(3) to represent a time  in  a  locale-
              specific way.


       DAY_{1-7} (LC_TIME)
              Return  name of the n-th day of the week. [Warning:
              this follows the US convention DAY_1 = Sunday,  not
              the international convention (ISO 8601) that Monday
              is the first day of the week.]


       ABDAY_{1-7} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of  the  n-th  day  of  the
              week.


       MON_{1-12} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th month.


       ABMON_{1-12} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th month.


       RADIXCHAR (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return radix character (decimal dot, decimal comma,
              etc.).


       THOUSEP (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return separator character for thousands (groups of
              three digits).


       YESEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return  a  regular expression that can be used with
              the  regex(3)  function  to  recognize  a  positive
              response to a yes/no question.


       NOEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return  a  regular expression that can be used with
              the  regex(3)  function  to  recognize  a  negative
              response to a yes/no question.


       CRNCYSTR (LC_MONETARY)
              Return  the currency symbol, preceded by "-" if the
              symbol should appear before the value, "+"  if  the
              symbol should appear after the value, or "." if the
              symbol should replace the radix character.

       The above list covers just some examples of items that can
       be requested. For a more detailed list, please consult The
       GNU C Library Reference Manual.

RETURN VALUE
       If no locale has been selected for the  appropriate  cate­
       gory,  nl_langinfo  returns a pointer to the corresponding
       string in the "C" locale.

       If item is not valid, a pointer  to  an  empty  string  is
       returned.

       This  pointer  may  point to static data that may be over­
       written on the next call to nl_langinfo or setlocale.
