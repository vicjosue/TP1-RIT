       These functions are used to obtain temporary BBIIGGNNUUMM
       variables from a BBNN_CCTTXX (which can been created by using
       BN_CTX_new(3)) in order to save the overhead of repeatedly
       creating and freeing BBIIGGNNUUMMs in functions that are called
       from inside a loop.

       A function must call BN_CTX_start() first. Then,
       BN_CTX_get() may be called repeatedly to obtain temporary
       BBIIGGNNUUMMs. All BN_CTX_get() calls must be made before
       calling any other functions that use the ccttxx as an
       argument.

       Finally, BN_CTX_end() must be called before returning from
       the function.  When BN_CTX_end() is called, the BBIIGGNNUUMM
       pointers obtained from BN_CTX_get() become invalid.

       BN_CTX_start() and BN_CTX_end() return no values.

       BN_CTX_get() returns a pointer to the BBIIGGNNUUMM, or NNUULLLL on
       error.  Once BN_CTX_get() has failed, the subsequent calls
       will return NNUULLLL as well, so it is sufficient to check the
       return value of the last BN_CTX_get() call. In case of an
       error, an error code is set, which can be obtained by
       ERR_get_error(3).
