DESCRIPTION
       Tk_SetAppName associates a name with a  given  application
       and  records  that  association  on the display containing
       with the application's main window.  After this  procedure
       has  been  invoked, other applications on the display will
       be able to use the send command to  invoke  operations  in
       the  application.  If name is already in use by some other
       application on the display, then a new name will be gener­
       ated  by  appending `` #2'' to name;  if this name is also
       in use, the number will be  incremented  until  an  unused
       name  is  found.  The return value from the procedure is a
       pointer to the name actually used.

       If the application already has a name  when  Tk_SetAppName
       is called, then the new name replaces the old name.

       Tk_SetAppName  also  adds  a  send command to the applica­
       tion's interpreter, which can be  used  to  send  commands
       from  this  application  to  others on any of the displays
       where the application has windows.

       The application's name  registration  persists  until  the
       interpreter is deleted or the send command is deleted from
       interp, at which point the name is automatically  unregis­
       tered  and  the application becomes inaccessible via send.
       The application can be made accessible  again  by  calling
       Tk_SetAppName.

       Tk_SetAppName  is  called  automatically  by  Tk_Init,  so
       applications don't normally need to call it explicitly.

       The command tk appname provides Tcl-level  access  to  the
       functionality of Tk_SetAppName.
