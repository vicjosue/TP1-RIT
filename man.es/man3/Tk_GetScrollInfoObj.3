NAME
       Tk_GetScrollInfo,  Tk_GetScrollInfoObj  -  parse arguments
       for scrolling commands

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfo(interp, argc, argv, dblPtr, intPtr)

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj(interp, objc, objv, dblPtr, intPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp   *interp   (in)      Interpreter  to  use  for
                                        error reporting.

       int          argc      (in)      Number of strings in argv
                                        array.

       char         *argv[]   (in)      Argument strings.   These
                                        represent the entire wid­
                                        get command, of which the
                                        first  word  is typically
                                        the widget name  and  the
                                        second  word is typically
                                        xview or yview.

       int          objc      (in)      Number  of  Tcl_Obj's  in
                                        objv array.

       Tcl_Obj *CONST         objv[](in)
                                        Argument  objects.  These
                                        represent the entire wid­
                                        get command, of which the
                                        first word  is  typically
                                        the  widget  name and the
                                        second word is  typically
                                        xview or yview.

       double       *dblPtr   (out)     Filled  in  with fraction
                                        from  moveto  option,  if
                                        any.

       int          *intPtr   (out)     Filled  in  with  line or
                                        page  count  from  scroll
                                        option,   if   any.   The

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetScrollInfo parses the arguments expected  by  widget
       scrolling  commands  such as xview and yview.  It receives
       the entire list of words that make up a widget command and
       parses  the words starting with argv[2].  The words start­
       ing with argv[2] must have one of the following forms:
              moveto fraction
              scroll number units
              scroll number pages

       Any of the moveto, scroll, units, and pages  keywords  may
       be   abbreviated.    If   argv   has   the   moveto  form,
       TK_SCROLL_MOVETO is returned  as  result  and  *dblPtr  is
       filled in with the fraction argument to the command, which
       must be a proper real value.  If argv has the scroll form,
       TK_SCROLL_UNITS or TK_SCROLL_PAGES is returned and *intPtr
       is filled in with the number value, which must be a proper
       integer.   If  an  error  occurs in parsing the arguments,
       TK_SCROLL_ERROR is returned and an error message  is  left
       in interp->result.

       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj    is   identical   in   function   to
       Tk_GetScrollInfo.   However,  Tk_GetScrollInfoObj  accepts
       Tcl_Obj  style  arguments,  making it more appropriate for
       use with new development.
