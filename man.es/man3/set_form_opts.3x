form_opts(3X)                                       form_opts(3X)



NAME
       form_opts - set and get form options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_form_opts(FORM *form, OPTIONS opts);
       int form_opts_on(FORM *form, OPTIONS opts);
       int form_opts_off(FORM *form, OPTIONS opts);
       OPTIONS form_opts(const FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  set_form_opts  sets  all  the  given form's
       option bits  (form  option  bits  may  be  logically-OR'ed
       together).

       The  function form_opts_on turns on the given option bits,
       and leaves others alone.

       The function form_opts_off  turns  off  the  given  option
       bits, and leaves others alone.

       The  function  form_opts returns the form's current option
       bits.

       The following options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_NL_OVERLOAD
            Overload  the  REQ_NEW_LINE  forms  driver request so
            that calling it at the end of a  field  goes  to  the
            next field.

       O_BS_OVERLOAD
            Overload  the  REQ_DEL_PREV  forms  driver request so
            that calling it at the beginning of a field  goes  to
            the previous field.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for form_opts, each routine returns one of the fol­
       lowing:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The header file <form.h> automatically includes the header
       file <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines  emulate the System V forms library.  They
       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
