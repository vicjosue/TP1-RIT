curs_inch(3X)                                       curs_inch(3X)



NAME
       inch,  winch,  mvinch,  mvwinch  -  get  a  character  and
       attributes from a curses window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       chtype inch(void);
       chtype winch(WINDOW *win);
       chtype mvinch(int y, int x);
       chtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);

DESCRIPTION
       These routines return the character, of  type  chtype,  at
       the   current  position  in  the  named  window.   If  any
       attributes are set for that  position,  their  values  are
       OR'ed  into  the  value  returned.   Constants  defined in
       <curses.h> can be used with the & (logical  AND)  operator
       to extract the character or attributes alone.


   Attributes
       The  following  bit-masks  may  be  AND-ed with characters
       returned by winch.

       A_CHARTEXT     Bit-mask to extract character
       A_ATTRIBUTES   Bit-mask to extract attributes
       A_COLOR        Bit-mask to extract color-pair field information

NOTES
       Note that all of these routines may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses  standard,
       Issue 4.
