       SSL_accept() waits for a TLS/SSL client to initiate the
       TLS/SSL handshake.  The communication channel must already
       have been set and assigned to the ssssll by setting an
       underlying BBIIOO.

NNOOTTEESS
       The behaviour of SSL_accept() depends on the underlying
       BIO.

       If the underlying BIO is bblloocckkiinngg, SSL_accept() will only
       return once the handshake has been finished or an error
       occurred, except for SGC (Server Gated Cryptography). For
       SGC, SSL_accept() may return with -1, but SSL_get_error()
       will yield SSSSLL_EERRRROORR_WWAANNTT_RREEAADD//WWRRIITTEE and SSL_accept()
       should be called again.

       If the underlying BIO is nnoonn--bblloocckkiinngg, SSL_accept() will
       also return when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the
       needs of SSL_accept() to continue the handshake. In this
       case a call to SSL_get_error() with the return value of
       SSL_accept() will yield SSSSLL_EERRRROORR_WWAANNTT_RREEAADD or
       SSSSLL_EERRRROORR_WWAANNTT_WWRRIITTEE. The calling process then must repeat
       the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the
       needs of SSL_accept().  The action depends on the
       underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing
       is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the
       required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO
       pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the
       BIO before being able to continue.

       The following return values can occur:

       1   The TLS/SSL handshake was successfully completed, a
           TLS/SSL connection has been established.

       0   The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful but was shut
           down controlled and by the specifications of the
           TLS/SSL protocol. Call SSL_get_error() with the return
           value rreett to find out the reason.

       <0  The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful because a
           fatal error occurred either at the protocol level or a
           connection failure occurred. The shutdown was not
           clean. It can also occur of action is need to continue
           the operation for non-blocking BIOs. Call
           SSL_get_error() with the return value rreett to find out
           the reason.
