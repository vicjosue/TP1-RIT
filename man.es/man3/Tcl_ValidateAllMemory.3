DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide access  to  Tcl  memory  debugging
       information.   They  are  only available when Tcl has been
       compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG defined at compile-time.

       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory will output a list of  all  currently
       allocated  memory  to the specified file.  The information
       output for each allocated block of  memory  is:   starting
       and  ending addresses (excluding guard zone), size, source
       file where ckalloc was called to allocate  the  block  and
       line number in that file.  It is especially useful to call
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory after the Tcl  interpreter  has  been
       deleted.

       Tcl_InitMemory  adds  the Tcl memory command to the inter­
       preter given by interp.  It is called by Tcl_Main when Tcl
       has been compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG defined.

       Tcl_ValidateAllMemory  forces  a  validation  of the guard
       zones of all currently allocated blocks of  memory.   Nor­
       mally  validation of a block occurs when its freed, unless
       full validation is enabled, in which  case  validation  of
       all  blocks  occurs  when  ckalloc  and ckfree are called.
       This function forces the validation to occur at any point.
