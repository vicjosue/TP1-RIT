GETWCHAR(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         GETWCHAR(3)



NAME
       getwchar - read a wide character from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t getwchar(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getwchar function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the getchar function. It reads a wide character from stdin
       and  returns  it.  If  the end of stream is reached, or if
       ferror(stdin) becomes true, it returns  WEOF.  If  a  wide
       character conversion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ
       and returns WEOF.

       For a non-locking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The getwchar function returns the next wide-character from
       standard input, or WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

NOTES
       The behaviour of getwchar depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       It is reasonable to expect  that  getwchar  will  actually
       read  a  multibyte  sequence  from standard input and then
       convert it to a wide character.
