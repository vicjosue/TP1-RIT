FSEEKO(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           FSEEKO(3)



NAME
       fseeko, ftello - seek to or report file position

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fseeko(FILE *stream, off_t offset, int whence);

       off_t ftello(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fseeko()  and  ftello()  functions  are  identical to
       fseek() and ftell() (see fseek(3)),  respectively,  except
       that  the offset argument of fseeko() and the return value
       of ftello() is of type off_t instead of long.

       On many architectures  both  off_t  and  long  are  32-bit
       types, but compilation with
              #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
       will turn off_t into a 64-bit type.

NOTES
       These  functions are found on SysV-like systems.  They are
       not present in libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0 but available since
       glibc 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       The fseeko and ftello functions conform to SUSv2.
