DESCRIPTION
       Tk_HandleEvent is a lower-level procedure that deals  with
       window  events.   It  is  called  by Tcl_ServiceEvent (and
       indirectly by Tk_DoOneEvent), and in  a  few  other  cases
       within  Tk.   It  makes callbacks to any window event han­
       dlers (created by  calls  to  Tk_CreateEventHandler)  that
       match  eventPtr and then returns.  In some cases it may be
       useful for an application to bypass the Tk event queue and
       call    Tk_HandleEvent   directly   instead   of   calling
       Tcl_QueueEvent followed by Tcl_ServiceEvent.

       This procedure may be invoked recursively.   For  example,
       it is possible to invoke Tk_HandleEvent recursively from a
       handler called by Tk_HandleEvent.  This sort of  operation
       is  useful  in some modal situations, such as when a noti­
       fier has been popped up and an application wishes to  wait
       for  the  user  to  click  a button in the notifier before
       doing anything else.
