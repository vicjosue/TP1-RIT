       SSL_state_string() returns a 6 letter string indicating
       the current state of the SSL object ssssll.

       SSL_state_string_long() returns a string indicating the
       current state of the SSL object ssssll.

       During its use, an SSL objects passes several states. The
       state is internally maintained. Querying the state
       information is not very informative before or when a
       connection has been established. It however can be of
       significant interest during the handshake.

       When using non-blocking sockets, the function call
       performing the handshake may return with
       SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE condition, so
       that SSL_state_string[_long]() may be called.

       For both blocking or non-blocking sockets, the details
       state information can be used within the info_callback
       function set with the SSL_set_info_callback() call.
