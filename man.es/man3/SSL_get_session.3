       SSL_get_session() returns a pointer to the SSSSLL_SSEESSSSIIOONN
       actually used in ssssll. The reference count of the
       SSSSLL_SSEESSSSIIOONN is not incremented, so that the pointer can
       become invalid by other operations.

       SSL_get0_session() is the same as SSL_get_session().

       SSL_get1_session() is the same as SSL_get_session(), but
       the reference count of the SSSSLL_SSEESSSSIIOONN is incremented by
       one.

       The ssl session contains all information required to re-
       establish the connection without a new handshake.

       SSL_get0_session() returns a pointer to the actual
       session. As the reference counter is not incremented, the
       pointer is only valid while the connection is in use. If
       SSL_clear(3) or SSL_free(3) is called, the session may be
       removed completely (if considered bad), and the pointer
       obtained will become invalid. Even if the session is
       valid, it can be removed at any time due to timeout during
       SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3).

       If the data is to be kept, SSL_get1_session() will
       increment the reference count, so that the session will
       not be implicitly removed by other operations but stays in
       memory. In order to remove the session SSL_SESSION_free(3)
       must be explicitly called once to decrement the reference
       count again.

       SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about
       the session cache list, when being inserted into one
       SSL_CTX object's session cache.  One SSL_SESSION object,
       regardless of its reference count, must therefore only be
       used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects created
       from this SSL_CTX object).

       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           There is no session available in ssssll.

       Pointer to an SSL
           The return value points to the data of an SSL session.
