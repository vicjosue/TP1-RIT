DESCRIPTION
       These procedures may be used to map and unmap windows man­
       aged by Tk.  Tk_MapWindow maps the window given by  tkwin,
       and  also creates an X window corresponding to tkwin if it
       doesn't already exist.   See  the  Tk_CreateWindow  manual
       entry   for   information  on  deferred  window  creation.
       Tk_UnmapWindow unmaps tkwin's window from the screen.

       If tkwin is a child window (i.e. Tk_CreateWindow was  used
       to  create a child window), then event handlers interested
       in map and unmap events are invoked immediately.  If tkwin
       isn't  an internal window, then the event handlers will be
       invoked later, after X has seen the request  and  returned
       an event for it.

       These  procedures  should be used in place of the X proce­
       dures XMapWindow and XUnmapWindow, since they update  Tk's
       local  data  structure  for  tkwin.  Applications using Tk
       should not invoke XMapWindow and XUnmapWindow directly.
