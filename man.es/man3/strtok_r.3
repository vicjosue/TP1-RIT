NAME
       strtok, strtok_r - extract tokens from strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strtok(char *s, const char *delim);

       char *strtok_r(char *s, const char *delim, char **ptrptr);

DESCRIPTION
       A `token' is a nonempty string of characters not occurring
       in the string delim, followed by  \0  or  by  a  character
       occurring in delim.

       The  strtok()  function  can be used to parse the string s
       into tokens. The first call to strtok() should have  s  as
       its first argument. Subsequent calls should have the first
       argument set to NULL. Each call returns a pointer  to  the
       next token, or NULL when no more tokens are found.

       If  a token ends with a delimiter, this delimiting charac­
       ter is overwritten with a \0 and a  pointer  to  the  next
       character  is  saved  for  the next call to strtok().  The
       delimiter string delim may be different for each call.

       The strtok_r() function is a reentrant version of the str­
       tok()  function,  which  instead  of  using its own static
       buffer, requires a pointer to a user allocated char*. This
       pointer,  the  ptrptr  parameter,  must  be the same while
       parsing the same string.

BUGS
       Never use these functions. If you do, note that:

              These functions modify their first argument.

              These functions cannot be used on constant strings.

              The identity of the delimiting character is lost.

              The  strtok()  function  uses a static buffer while
              parsing, so it's not thread safe. Use strtok_r() if
              this matters to you.

RETURN VALUE
       The strtok() function returns a pointer to the next token,
       or NULL if there are no more tokens.
