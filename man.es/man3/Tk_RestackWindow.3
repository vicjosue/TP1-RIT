DESCRIPTION
       Tk_RestackWindow changes the stacking order of window rel­
       ative to its siblings.  If other is specified as NULL then
       window is repositioned at the top or bottom of its  stack­
       ing  order,  depending  on  whether aboveBelow is Above or
       Below.  If other has a non-NULL value then window is repo­
       sitioned just above or below other.

       The aboveBelow argument must have one of the symbolic val­
       ues Above or Below.  Both of these values are  defined  by
       the include file <X11/Xlib.h>.
