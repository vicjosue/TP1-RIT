NAME
       btowc - convert single byte to wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t btowc(int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The  btowc function converts c, interpreted as a multibyte
       sequence of length 1, starting in the initial shift state,
       to  a  wide character and returns it. If c is EOF or not a
       valid multibyte sequence of length 1, the  btowc  function
       returns WEOF.

RETURN VALUE
       The  btowc  function  returns the wide character converted
       from the single byte c. If c is EOF or not a valid  multi­
       byte sequence of length 1, it returns WEOF.

CONFORMING TO

SEE ALSO
       mbtowc(3)

NOTES
       The behaviour of btowc depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
       the current locale.

       This function should never be used. It does not  work  for
       encodings  which have state, and unnecessarily treats sin­
       gle bytes differently from multibyte  sequences.  Use  the
       function mbtowc instead.
