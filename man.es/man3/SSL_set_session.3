       SSL_set_session() sets sseessssiioonn to be used when the TLS/SSL
       connection is to be established. SSL_set_session() is only
       useful for TLS/SSL clients.  When the session is set, the
       reference count of sseessssiioonn is incremented by 1. If the
       session is not reused, the reference count is decremented
       again during SSL_connect(). Whether the session was reused
       can be queried with the SSL_session_reused(3) call.

       If there is already a session set inside ssssll (because it
       was set with SSL_set_session() before or because the same
       ssssll was already used for a connection), SSL_SESSION_free()
       will be called for that session.

NNOOTTEESS
       SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about
       the session cache list, when being inserted into one
       SSL_CTX object's session cache.  One SSL_SESSION object,
       regardless of its reference count, must therefore only be
       used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects created
       from this SSL_CTX object).

       The following return values can occur:

       0   The operation failed; check the error stack to find
           out the reason.

       1   The operation succeeded.
