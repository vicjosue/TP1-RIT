NAME
       Tcl_NewDoubleObj, Tcl_SetDoubleObj, Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj -
       manipulate Tcl objects as floating-point values

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_Obj *
       Tcl_NewDoubleObj(doubleValue)

       Tcl_SetDoubleObj(objPtr, doubleValue)

       int
       Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj(interp, objPtr, doublePtr)

ARGUMENTS
       double       doubleValue   (in)      A    double-precision
                                            floating  point value
                                            used to initialize or
                                            set  a double object.

       Tcl_Obj      *objPtr       (in/out)  For Tcl_SetDoubleObj,
                                            this  points  to  the
                                            object  to  be   con­
                                            verted    to   double
                                            type.   For  Tcl_Get­
                                            DoubleFromObj,   this
                                            refers to the  object
                                            from  which  to get a
                                            double   value;    if
                                            objPtr    does    not
                                            already  point  to  a
                                            double   object,   an
                                            attempt will be  made
                                            to convert it to one.

       Tcl_Interp   *interp       (in/out)  If  an  error  occurs
                                            during conversion, an
                                            error message is left
                                            in  the interpreter's
                                            result object  unless
                                            interp is NULL.

       double       *doublePtr    (out)     Points  to  place  to
                                            store   the    double
                                            value  obtained  from
                                            objPtr.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures are used to create, modify, and read dou­
       ble   Tcl  objects  from  C  code.   Tcl_NewDoubleObj  and
       Tcl_SetDoubleObj will create a new object of  double  type
       or modify an existing object to have double type.  Both of
       these procedures set the object to have the  double-preci­
       sion  floating  point value given by doubleValue; Tcl_New­
       DoubleObj returns a pointer to a newly created object with
       reference  count  zero.   Both procedures set the object's
       type to be double and  assign  the  double  value  to  the
       object's   internal   representation  doubleValue  member.
       Tcl_SetDoubleObj invalidates any old string representation
       and,  if  the object is not already a double object, frees
       any old internal representation.

       Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj attempts to  return  a  double  value
       from  the Tcl object objPtr.  If the object is not already
       a double object, it will attempt to convert it to one.  If
       an  error  occurs  during conversion, it returns TCL_ERROR
       and leaves an error message in  the  interpreter's  result
       object  unless  interp  is  NULL.   Otherwise,  it returns
       TCL_OK and stores the double value in the address given by
       doublePtr.   If the object is not already a double object,
       the conversion will free any old internal  representation.
