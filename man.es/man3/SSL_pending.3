       SSL_pending - obtain number of readable bytes buffered in
       an SSL object

       SSL_pending() returns the number of bytes which are
       available inside ssssll for immediate read.

       Data are received in blocks from the peer. Therefore data
       can be buffered inside ssssll and are ready for immediate
       retrieval with SSL_read(3).

       The number of bytes pending is returned.

       SSL_pending() takes into account only bytes from the
       TLS/SSL record that is currently being processed (if any).
       If the SSSSLL object's read_ahead flag is set, additional
       protocol bytes may have been read containing more TLS/SSL
       records; these are ignored by SSL_pending().

       Up to OpenSSL 0.9.6, SSL_pending() does not check if the
       record type of pending data is application data.
