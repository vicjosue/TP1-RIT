DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_UpVar and Tcl_UpVar2 provide the same functionality as
       the  upvar  command:  they make a link from a source vari­
       able to a destination variable, so that references to  the
       destination   are  passed  transparently  through  to  the
       source.  The name of the source variable may be  specified
       either as a single string such as xyx or a(24) (by calling
       Tcl_UpVar) or in two parts where the array name  has  been
       separated  from  the element name (by calling Tcl_UpVar2).
       The destination variable name is  specified  in  a  single
       string;  it may not be an array element.

       Both  procedures  return  either  TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR, and
       they leave an error message in the interpreter's result if
       an error occurs.

       As  with  the  upvar command, the source variable need not
       exist; if it does  exist,  unsetting  it  later  does  not
       destroy  the  link.  The destination variable may exist at
       the time of the call, but if so it must exist as a  linked
       variable.
