       SSL_get_peer_cert_chain() returns a pointer to
       STACKOF(X509) certificates forming the certificate chain
       of the peer. If called on the client side, the stack also
       contains the peer's certificate; if called on the server
       side, the peer's certificate must be obtained separately
       using SSL_get_peer_certificate(3).  If the peer did not
       present a certificate, NULL is returned.

NNOOTTEESS
       The peer certificate chain is not necessarily available
       after reusing a session, in which case a NULL pointer is
       returned.

       The reference count of the STACKOF(X509) object is not
       incremented.  If the corresponding session is freed, the
       pointer must not be used any longer.

       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no
           connection was established or the certificate chain is
           no longer available when a session is reused.

       Pointer to a STACKOF(X509)
           The return value points to the certificate chain
           presented by the peer.
