DESCRIPTION
       When Tk creates a new window it  assigns  it  the  default
       visual  characteristics  (visual, depth, and colormap) for
       its screen.  Tk_SetWindowVisual may be  called  to  change
       them.  Tk_SetWindowVisual must be called before the window
       has actually been created in X (e.g.  before  Tk_MapWindow
       or  Tk_MakeWindowExist  has  been invoked for the window).
       The safest thing is to call Tk_SetWindowVisual immediately
       after  calling Tk_CreateWindow.  If tkwin has already been
       created  before  Tk_SetWindowVisual  is  called  then   it
       returns  0  and  doesn't  make  any changes;  otherwise it
       returns 1 to signify that the operation completed success­
       fully.

       Note:  Tk_SetWindowVisual should not be called if you just
       want to change a window's colormap  without  changing  its
       visual or depth; call Tk_SetWindowColormap instead.
