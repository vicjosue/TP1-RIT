       char          *path        (in)      File path in  a  form
                                            appropriate  for  the
                                            current platform (see
                                            the  filename  manual
                                            entry for  acceptable
                                            forms     for    path
                                            names).

       int           *argcPtr     (out)     Filled in with number
                                            of  path  elements in
                                            path.

       char          ***argvPtr   (out)     *argvPtr   will    be
                                            filled  in  with  the
                                            address of  an  array
                                            of  pointers  to  the
                                            strings that are  the
                                            extracted elements of
                                            path.  There will  be
                                            *argcPtr        valid
                                            entries in the array,
                                            followed  by  a  NULL
                                            entry.

       int           argc         (in)      Number of elements in
                                            argv.

       char          **argv       (in)      Array  of  path  ele­
                                            ments    to     merge
                                            together  into a sin­
                                            gle path.

       Tcl_DString   *resultPtr   (in/out)  A pointer to an  ini­
                                            tialized  Tcl_DString
                                            to which  the  result
                                            of  Tcl_JoinPath will
                                            be appended.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures may be used to disassemble and reassemble
       file  paths in a platform independent manner: they provide
       C-level access to  the  same  functionality  as  the  file
       split, file join, and file pathtype commands.

       Tcl_SplitPath breaks a path into its constituent elements,
       returning an array  of  pointers  to  the  elements  using
       argcPtr  and  argvPtr.   The  area of memory pointed to by
       *argvPtr is dynamically  allocated;  in  addition  to  the
       array  of  pointers,  it also holds copies of all the path
       elements.  It is the caller's responsibility to  free  all
       of  this  storage.   For  example,  suppose  that you have
       called Tcl_SplitPath with the following code:
              int argc;
              char *path;
              char **argv;
              ...
              Tcl_SplitPath(string, &argc, &argv);
       Then you should eventually free the storage  with  a  call
       like the following:
              Tcl_Free((char *) argv);

       Tcl_JoinPath  is  the inverse of Tcl_SplitPath: it takes a
       collection of path elements given by  argc  and  argv  and
       generates  a  result string that is a properly constructed
       path.  The  result  string  is  appended   to   resultPtr.
       ResultPtr must refer to an initialized Tcl_DString.

       If  the result of Tcl_SplitPath is passed to Tcl_JoinPath,
       the result will refer to the same location, but may not be
       in  the  same  form.   This  is  because Tcl_SplitPath and
       Tcl_JoinPath  eliminate  duplicate  path  separators   and
       return a normalized form for each platform.

       Tcl_GetPathType  returns  the  type of the specified path,
       where   Tcl_PathType   is   one   of    TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE,
       TCL_PATH_RELATIVE,  or  TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE.  See the
       filename manual entry for a description of the path  types
       for each platform.
