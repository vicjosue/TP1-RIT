LWRES_GETNAMEINFO(3)                         LWRES_GETNAMEINFO(3)



NAME
       lwres_getnameinfo  -  lightweight  resolver socket address
       structure to hostname and service name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <lwres/netdb.h>

       int lwres_getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, size_t
       salen, char *host, size_t hostlen, char *serv, size_t
       servlen, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       This function is equivalent to the getnameinfo(3) function
       defined in RFC2133.  lwres_getnameinfo() returns the host­
       name for the struct sockaddr sa which is salen bytes long.
       The  hostname  is  of  length  hostlen and is returned via
       *host. The maximum length of the hostname is  1025  bytes:
       NI_MAXHOST.

       The name of the service associated with the port number in
       sa is returned in *serv.  It is servlen  bytes  long.  The
       maximum  length  of  the  service  name is NI_MAXSERV - 32
       bytes.

       The flags argument sets the following bits:

       NI_NOFQDN
              A fully qualified domain name is not  required  for
              local hosts.  The local part of the fully qualified
              domain name is returned instead.

       NI_NUMERICHOST
              Return the address in numeric form, as  if  calling
              inet_ntop(), instead of a host name.

       NI_NAMEREQD
              A name is required. If the hostname cannot be found
              in the DNS and this flag is set, a  non-zero  error
              code is returned.  If the hostname is not found and
              the flag is not set, the  address  is  returned  in
              numeric form.

       NI_NUMERICSERV
              The service name is returned as a digit string rep­
              resenting the port number.

       NI_DGRAM
              Specifies that the service being  looked  up  is  a
              datagram  service, and causes getservbyport() to be
              called with a second argument of "udp"  instead  of
              its  default of "tcp". This is required for the few
              ports (512-514) that have  different  services  for
              UDP and TCP.

RETURN VALUES
       lwres_getnameinfo()  returns  0  on  success or a non-zero
       error code if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
       RFC2133, getservbyport(3), lwres(3), lwres_getnameinfo(3),
       lwres_getnamebyaddr(3).  lwres_net_ntop(3).

BUGS
       RFC2133  fails to define what the nonzero return values of
       getnameinfo(3) are.
