DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures are invoked by widgets that wish to dis­
       play images.  Tk_GetImage is invoked by a widget  when  it
       first decides to display an image.  name gives the name of
       the desired image and tkwin identifies  the  window  where
       the  image  will  be  displayed.  Tk_GetImage looks up the
       image in the table of existing images and returns a  token
       for  a  new  instance  of the image.  If the image doesn't
       exist then Tk_GetImage returns NULL and  leaves  an  error
       message in interp->result.

       When  a widget wishes to actually display an image it must
       call Tk_RedrawImage,  identifying  the  image  (image),  a
       region  within  the  image  to  redisplay (imageX, imageY,
       width, and height), and  a  place  to  display  the  image
       (drawable, drawableX, and drawableY).  Tk will then invoke
       the appropriate image  manager,  which  will  display  the
       requested portion of the image before returning.

       A  widget can find out the dimensions of an image by call­
       ing Tk_SizeOfImage:  the width and height will  be  stored
       in  the locations given by widthPtr and heightPtr, respec­
       tively.

       When a widget is finished with an image (e.g., the  widget
       is  being  deleted or it is going to use a different image
       instead of the current one), it must call Tk_FreeImage  to
       release the image instance.  The widget should never again
       use the image token  after  passing  it  to  Tk_FreeImage.
       There  must  be  exactly one call to Tk_FreeImage for each
       call to Tk_GetImage.

       If the contents or size of an image changes, then any wid­
       gets  using  the  image  will  need  to find out about the
       changes  so  that  they  can  redisplay  themselves.   The
       changeProc  and  clientData  arguments  to Tk_GetImage are
       used for this purpose.  changeProc will be  called  by  Tk
       whenever  a change occurs in the image;  it must match the
       following prototype:
              typedef void Tk_ImageChangedProc(
                ClientData clientData,
                int x,
                int y,
                int width,
                int height,
                int imageWidth,
                int imageHeight);
       The clientData argument to changeProc is the same  as  the
       clientData  argument  to  Tk_GetImage.   It  is  usually a
       pointer to the widget record for the widget or some  other
       data structure managed by the widget.  The arguments x, y,
       width, and height identify a region within the image  that
       must be redisplayed; they are specified in pixels measured
       from the upper-left corner of the  image.   The  arguments
       imageWidth and imageHeight give the image's (new) size.
