NAME
       Tcl_AllowExceptions  - allow all exceptions in next script
       evaluation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_AllowExceptions(interp)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp   *interp      (in)      Interpreter  in  which
                                           script  will be evalu­

DESCRIPTION
       If a script is  evaluated  at  top-level  (i.e.  no  other
       scripts   are   pending  evaluation  when  the  script  is
       invoked), and if the script terminates with  a  completion
       code  other  than TCL_OK, TCL_CONTINUE or TCL_RETURN, then
       Tcl normally converts this into a TCL_ERROR return with an
       appropriate message.

       However,  if  Tcl_AllowExceptions  is  invoked immediately
       before calling a procedure such as  Tcl_Eval,  then  arbi­
       trary  completion codes are permitted from the script, and
       they are returned without modification.  This is useful in
       cases  where  the  caller can deal with exceptions such as
       TCL_BREAK or TCL_CONTINUE in a meaningful way.
