       SSL_set_accept_state() sets ssssll to work in server mode.

       When the SSL_CTX object was created with SSL_CTX_new(3),
       it was either assigned a dedicated client method, a
       dedicated server method, or a generic method, that can be
       used for both client and server connections. (The method
       might have been changed with SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(3) or
       SSL_set_ssl_method().)

       When beginning a new handshake, the SSL engine must know
       whether it must call the connect (client) or accept
       (server) routines. Even though it may be clear from the
       method chosen, whether client or server mode was
       requested, the handshake routines must be explicitly set.

       When using the SSL_connect(3) or SSL_accept(3) routines,
       the correct handshake routines are automatically set. When
       performing a transparent negotiation using SSL_write(3) or
       SSL_read(3), the handshake routines must be explicitly set
       in advance using either SSL_set_connect_state() or
       SSL_set_accept_state().
