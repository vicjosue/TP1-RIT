NAME
       strnlen - determine the length of a fixed-size string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strnlen(const char *s, size_t maxlen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strnlen  function returns the number of characters in
       the string pointed to by s, not including the  terminating
       '\0' character, but at most maxlen. In doing this, strnlen
       looks only at the first maxlen characters at s  and  never
       beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strnlen  function  returns strlen(s), if that is less
       than maxlen, or maxlen if there is no '\0' character among
       the first maxlen characters pointed to by s.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
