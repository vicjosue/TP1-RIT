ROUND(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual            ROUND(3)



NAME
       round,  roundf,  roundl  -  round to nearest integer, away
       from zero

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double round(double x);
       float roundf(float x);
       long double roundl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions round x to the nearest integer, but  round
       halfway  cases  away  from zero (regardless of the current
       rounding direction), instead of to the nearest even  inte­
       ger like rint().

RETURN VALUE
       The rounded integer value. If x is integral or infinite, x
       itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors other than EDOM and ERANGE can occur.  If  x  is
       NaN, then NaN is returned and errno may be set to EDOM.

NOTES
       POSIX  1003.1-2001  contains  text  about  overflow (which
       might set errno to ERANGE, or  raise  an  exception).   In
       practice,  the  result  cannot  overflow  on  any  current
       machine, so this error-handling stuff  is  just  nonsense.
       (More precisely, overflow can happen only when the maximum
       value of the exponent is smaller than the number  of  man­
       tissa  bits.   For the IEEE-754 standard 32-bit and 64-bit
       floating point numbers the maximum value of  the  exponent
       is 128 (resp. 1024), and the number of mantissa bits is 24
       (resp. 53).)

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
