DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetGC and Tk_FreeGC manage  a  collection  of  graphics
       contexts  being  used  by  an application.  The procedures
       allow graphics contexts to be shared, thereby avoiding the
       server  overhead  that  would be incurred if a separate GC
       were created  for  each  use.   Tk_GetGC  takes  arguments
       describing  the  desired graphics context and returns an X
       identifier for a GC that fits the description.  The graph­
       ics  context  that is returned will have default values in
       all of the fields not specified  explicitly  by  valueMask
       and valuePtr.

       Tk_GetGC maintains a database of all the graphics contexts
       it has created.  Whenever possible,  a  call  to  Tk_GetGC
       will  return an existing graphics context rather than cre­
       ating a new one.  This approach can  substantially  reduce
       server  overhead,  so Tk_GetGC should generally be used in
       preference to the Xlib procedure XCreateGC, which  creates
       a new graphics context on each call.

       Since  the  return  values of Tk_GetGC are shared, callers
       should never modify  the  graphics  contexts  returned  by
       Tk_GetGC.   If a graphics context must be modified dynami­
       cally, then it should  be  created  by  calling  XCreateGC
       instead of Tk_GetGC.

       When  a  graphics  context  is no longer needed, Tk_FreeGC
       should be called to release it.  There should  be  exactly
       one  call  to Tk_FreeGC for each call to Tk_GetGC.  When a
       graphics context is no longer in use anywhere (i.e. it has
       been  freed as many times as it has been gotten) Tk_FreeGC
       will release it to the X server and  delete  it  from  the
       database.
