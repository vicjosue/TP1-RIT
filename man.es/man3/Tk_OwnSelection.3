DESCRIPTION
       Tk_OwnSelection arranges for tkwin to become the new owner
       of  the  selection specified by the atom selection.  After
       this call completes, future  requests  for  the  selection
       will  be  directed  to  handlers  created  for tkwin using
       Tk_CreateSelHandler.   When  tkwin  eventually  loses  the
       selection ownership, proc will be invoked so that the win­
       dow can clean itself up (e.g. by unhighlighting the selec­
       tion).   Proc  should have arguments and result that match
       the type Tk_LostSelProc:
              typedef void Tk_LostSelProc(ClientData clientData);
       The clientData parameter to proc is a copy of the  client­
       Data  argument  given to Tk_OwnSelection, and is usually a
       pointer to a data  structure  containing  application-spe­
       cific information about tkwin.
