       SSL_free() decrements the reference count of ssssll, and
       removes the SSL structure pointed to by ssssll and frees up
       the allocated memory if the the reference count has
       reached 0.

NNOOTTEESS
       SSL_free() also calls the free()ing procedures for
       indirectly affected items, if applicable: the buffering
       BIO, the read and write BIOs, cipher lists specially
       created for this ssssll, the SSSSLL_SSEESSSSIIOONN.  Do not explicitly
       free these indirectly freed up items before or after
       calling SSL_free(), as trying to free things twice may
       lead to program failure.

       The ssl session has reference counts from two users: the
       SSL object, for which the reference count is removed by
       SSL_free() and the internal session cache. If the session
       is considered bad, because SSL_shutdown(3) was not called
       for the connection and SSL_set_shutdown(3) was not used to
       set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state, the session will also be
       removed from the session cache as required by RFC2246.
