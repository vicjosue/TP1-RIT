       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() sets the verification
       callback function for ccttxx. SSL objects, that are created
       from ccttxx inherit the setting valid at the time, SSL_new(3)
       is called. aarrgg is currently ignored.

NNOOTTEESS
       Whenever a certificate is verified during a SSL/TLS
       handshake, a verification function is called. If the
       application does not explicitly specify a verification
       callback function, the built-in verification function is
       used.  If a verification callback ccaallllbbaacckk is specified
       via SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(), the supplied
       callback function is called instead. By setting ccaallllbbaacckk
       to NULL, the default behaviour is restored.

       When the verification must be performed, ccaallllbbaacckk will be
       called with the argument callback(X509_STORE_CTX
       *x509_store_ctx). The arguments aarrgg that can be specified
       when setting ccaallllbbaacckk are currently ignored.

       ccaallllbbaacckk should return 1 to indicate verification success
       and 0 to indicate verification failure. If SSL_VERIFY_PEER
       is set and ccaallllbbaacckk returns 0, the handshake will fail. As
       the verification procedure may allow to continue the
       connection in case of failure (by always returning 1) the
       verification result must be set in any case using the
       eerrrroorr member of xx550099_ssttoorree_ccttxx, so that the calling
       application will be informed about the detailed result of
       the verification procedure!

       Within xx550099_ssttoorree_ccttxx, ccaallllbbaacckk has access to the
       vveerriiffyy_ccaallllbbaacckk function set using SSL_CTX_set_verify(3).

WWAARRNNIINNGGSS
       Do not mix the verification callback described in this
       function with the vveerriiffyy_ccaallllbbaacckk function called during
       the verification process. The latter is set using the
       SSL_CTX_set_verify(3) family of functions.

       Providing a complete verification procedure including
       certificate purpose settings etc is a complex task. The
       built-in procedure is quite powerful and in most cases it
       should be sufficient to modify its behaviour using the
       vveerriiffyy_ccaallllbbaacckk function.

BBUUGGSS
       It is possible to specify arguments to be passed to the
       verification callback.  Currently they are however not
       passed but ignored.

       The ccaallllbbaacckk function is not specified via a prototype, so
       that no type checking takes place.

       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() does not provide
       diagnostic information.
