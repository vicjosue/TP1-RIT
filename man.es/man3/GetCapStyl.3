DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetCapStyle  places  in  *capPtr the X cap style corre­
       sponding to string.  This will be one of the  values  Cap­
       Butt,  CapProjecting,  or  CapRound.  Cap styles are typi­
       cally used in X graphics contexts to indicate how the end-
       points of lines should be capped.  See the X documentation
       for information on what each style implies.

       Under normal circumstances the return value is TCL_OK  and
       interp  is  unused.  If string doesn't contain a valid cap
       style or an abbreviation of one of these  names,  then  an
       error  message  is  stored in interp->result, TCL_ERROR is
       returned, and *capPtr is unmodified.

       Tk_NameOfCapStyle is the  logical  inverse  of  Tk_GetCap­
       Style.   Given  a  cap  style such as CapButt it returns a
       statically-allocated string corresponding to cap.  If  cap
       isn't  a  legal  cap  style, then ``unknown cap style'' is
       returned.
