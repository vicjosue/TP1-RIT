       Tk_MainLoop()

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_MainLoop is a procedure that loops  repeatedly  calling
       Tcl_DoOneEvent.   It returns only when there are no appli­
       cations left in this process (i.e. no main  windows  exist
       anymore).   Most windowing applications will call Tk_Main­
       Loop after  initialization;  the  main  execution  of  the
       application will consist entirely of callbacks invoked via
       Tcl_DoOneEvent.
