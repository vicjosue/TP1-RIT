NAME
       fprintCacheEntry_s - Finger print cache entry.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fprint.h>


   Data Fields
       const char * dirName
       dev_t dev
       ino_t ino
       int isFake

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       Finger print cache entry.

       This is really a directory and symlink cache. We don't
       differentiate between the two. We can prepopulate it,
       which allows us to easily conduct 'fake' installs of a
       system w/o actually mounting filesystems.
