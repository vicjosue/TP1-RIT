LWRES_INETNTOP(3)                               LWRES_INETNTOP(3)



NAME
       lwres_net_ntop - lightweight resolver IP address presenta­
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       #include <lwres/net.h>

       const char * lwres_net_ntop(int af, const void *src, char
       *dst, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       lwres_net_ntop() converts an IP address of protocol family
       af -- IPv4 or IPv6 -- at location src from network  format
       to  its  conventional representation as a string. For IPv4
       addresses, that string would be a dotted-decimal. An  IPv6
       address   would   be  represented  in  colon  notation  as
       described in RFC1884.

       The generated string is copied to dst provided size  indi­
       cates  it is long enough to store the ASCII representation
       of the address.

RETURN VALUES
       If successful, the function returns dst: a  pointer  to  a
       string  containing the presentation format of the address.
       lwres_net_ntop() returns NULL and sets the global variable
       errno  to  EAFNOSUPPORT if the protocol family given in af
       is not supported.
