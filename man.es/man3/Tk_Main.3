DESCRIPTION
       Tk_Main  acts as the main program for most Tk-based appli­
       cations.  Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called main  any­
       more  because  it  is  part of the Tk library and having a
       function main in a library (particularly a shared library)
       causes  problems  on  many systems.  Having main in the Tk
       library would also make it hard to use Tk in C++ programs,
       since C++ programs must have special C++ main functions.

       Normally  each  application contains a small main function
       that does nothing but invoke Tk_Main.  Tk_Main  then  does
       all  the work of creating and running a wish-like applica­
       tion.

       When it is has finished its own initialization, but before
       it  processes  commands, Tk_Main calls the procedure given
       by the appInitProc argument.  This  procedure  provides  a
       ``hook''  for  the application to perform its own initial­
       ization, such as defining  application-specific  commands.
       The procedure must have an interface that matches the type
       Tcl_AppInitProc:
              typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);
       AppInitProc is almost always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit; for
       more  details on this procedure, see the documentation for
       Tcl_AppInit.
