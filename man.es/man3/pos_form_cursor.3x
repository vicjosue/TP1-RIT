NAME
       form_cursor - position a form window cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int pos_form_cursor(FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  pos_form_cursor  restores the cursor to the
       position required for the forms driver  to  continue  pro­
       cessing  requests.   This  is useful after curses routines
       have been called to do screen-painting in  response  to  a
       form operation.

RETURN VALUE
       This routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno).

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
            Routine  detected  an incorrect or out-of-range argu­
            ment.

       E_NOT_POSTED
            The form has not been posted.

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The header file <form.h> automatically includes the header
       file <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines  emulate the System V forms library.  They
       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
