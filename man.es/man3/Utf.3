DESCRIPTION
       These   routines   convert   between   UTF-8  strings  and
       Tcl_UniChars.  A Tcl_UniChar is a Unicode character repre­
       sented as an unsigned, fixed-size quantity.  A UTF-8 char­
       acter is a Unicode character  represented  as  a  varying-
       length  sequence  of up to TCL_UTF_MAX bytes.  A multibyte
       UTF-8 sequence consists of a lead byte  followed  by  some
       number of trail bytes.

       TCL_UTF_MAX  is  the maximum number of bytes that it takes
       to represent one Unicode character in the UTF-8  represen­
       tation.

       Tcl_UniCharToUtf  stores  the  Tcl_UniChar  ch  as a UTF-8
       string in starting at buf.  The return value is the number
       of bytes stored in buf.

       Tcl_UtfToUniChar reads one UTF-8 character starting at src
       and stores it as a  Tcl_UniChar  in  *chPtr.   The  return
       value  is  the number of bytes read from src..  The caller
       must ensure that the source buffer  is  long  enough  such
       that this routine does not run off the end and dereference
       non-existent or random memory; if  the  source  buffer  is
       known to be null terminated, this will not happen.  If the
       input is not in proper UTF-8 format, Tcl_UtfToUniChar will
       store  the  first  byte  of src in *chPtr as a Tcl_UniChar
       between 0x0000 and 0x00ff and return 1.

       Tcl_UniCharToUtfDString converts the given Unicode  string
       to  UTF-8,  storing the result in a previously-initialized
       Tcl_DString.  You must specify the  length  of  the  given
       Unicode  string.   The  return  value  is a pointer to the
       UTF-8 representation of the Unicode string.   Storage  for
       the   return   value   is  appended  to  the  end  of  the
       Tcl_DString.

       Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString coverts the given UTF-8 string  to
       Unicode,  storing the result in the previously-initialized
       Tcl_Dstring.  you may either specify  the  length  of  the
       given    UTF-8    string    or   "-1",   in   which   case
       Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString  uses  strlen  to  calculate   the
       length.  The return value is a pointer to the Unicode rep­
       resentation of the UTF-8 string.  Storage for  the  return
       value is appended to the end of the Tcl_DString.  The Uni­
       code string is terminated with a Unicode NULL character.

       Tcl_UniCharLen corresponds to strlen for  Unicode  charac­
       ters.   It  accepts  a  NULL-terminated Unicode string and
       returns the number of Unicode characters  (not  bytes)  in
       that string.

       Tcl_UniCharNcmp corresponds to strncmp for Unicode charac­
       ters.  It accepts two NULL-terminated Unicode strings  and
       the  number  of  characters to compare.  (Both strings are
       assumed   to   be   at   least   len   characters   long.)
       Tcl_UniCharNcmp  compares  the  two  strings character-by-
       character according to the Unicode character ordering.  It
       returns  an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0
       if the first string is greater than,  equal  to,  or  less
       than the second string respectively.

       Tcl_UtfNcmp  corresponds  to strncmp for UTF-8 strings. It
       accepts two NULL-terminated UTF-8 strings and  the  number
       of characters to compare.  (Both strings are assumed to be
       at least len characters long.)  Tcl_UtfNcmp  compares  the
       two  strings  character-by-character according to the Uni­
       code character ordering.  It returns  an  integer  greater
       than,  equal  to,  or  less  than 0 if the first string is
       greater than, equal to, or less  than  the  second  string
       respectively.

       Tcl_UtfNcasecmp   corresponds  to  strncasecmp  for  UTF-8
       strings.  It is similar to Tcl_UtfNcmp except  comparisons
       ignore  differences in case when comparing upper, lower or
       title case characters.

       Tcl_UtfCharComplete returns 1 if the source  UTF-8  string
       src  of  length  len bytes is long enough to be decoded by
       Tcl_UtfToUniChar, or 0 otherwise.  This function does  not
       guarantee  that the UTF-8 string is properly formed.  This
       routine is used by procedures that are operating on a byte
       at  a time and need to know if a full Tcl_UniChar has been
       seen.

       Tcl_NumUtfChars corresponds to strlen for  UTF-8  strings.
       It returns the number of Tcl_UniChars that are represented
       by the UTF-8 string src.  The length of the source  string
       is  len bytes.  If the length is negative, all bytes up to
       the first NULL byte are used.

       Tcl_UtfFindFirst corresponds to strchr for UTF-8  strings.
       It  returns  a  pointer  to  the  first  occurance  of the
       Tcl_UniChar ch in the NULL-terminated  UTF-8  string  src.
       The  NULL  terminator  is  considered  part  of  the UTF-8
       string.

       Tcl_UtfFindLast corresponds to strrchr for UTF-8  strings.
       It  returns  a  pointer  to  the  last  occurance  of  the
       Tcl_UniChar ch in the NULL terminated  UTF-8  string  src.
       The  NULL  terminator  is  considered  part  of  the UTF-8
       string.

       Given src, a pointer to some location in a  UTF-8  string,
       Tcl_UtfNext  returns a pointer to the next UTF-8 character
       in the string.  The caller must not ask for the next char­
       acter after the last character in the string.

       Given  src,  a pointer to some location in a UTF-8 string,
       Tcl_UtfPrev returns a pointer to the previous UTF-8  char­
       acter  in the string.  This function will not back up to a
       position before start, the start of the UTF-8 string.   If
       src  was already at start, the return value will be start.

       Tcl_UniCharAtIndex  corresponds  to  a  C   string   array
       dereference  or the Pascal Ord() function.  It returns the
       Tcl_UniChar represented at the  specified  character  (not
       byte)  index  in  the UTF-8 string src.  The source string
       must contain at least index characters.  Behavior is unde­
       fined if a negative index is given.

       Tcl_UtfAtIndex  returns a pointer to the specified charac­
       ter (not byte) index in the UTF-8 string src.  The  source
       string  must  contain  at least index characters.  This is
       equivalent to calling Tcl_UtfNext index times.  If a nega­
       tive  index  is  given,  the  return pointer points to the
       first character in the source string.

       Tcl_UtfBackslash is a utility procedure used by several of
       the  Tcl  commands.   It  parses  a backslash sequence and
       stores the properly formed UTF-8 character represented  by
       the  backslash sequence in the output buffer dst.  At most
       TCL_UTF_MAX bytes are stored in the buffer.   Tcl_UtfBack­
       slash  modifies *readPtr to contain the number of bytes in
       the backslash sequence, including the backslash character.
       The return value is the number of bytes stored in the out­
       put buffer.

       See the Tcl manual entry  for  information  on  the  valid
       backslash  sequences.   All  of the sequences described in
       the Tcl manual entry are supported by Tcl_UtfBackslash.
