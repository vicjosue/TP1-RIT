GETFSENT(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         GETFSENT(3)



NAME
       getfsent,  getfsspec, getfsfile, setfsent, endfsent - han­
       dle fstab entries

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fstab.h>

       void endfsent(void);

       struct fstab *getfsent(void);

       struct fstab *getfsfile(const char *mount_point);

       struct fstab *getfsspec(const char *special_file);

       int setfsent(void);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions read from the file /etc/fstab.  The struct
       fstab is defined by

       struct fstab {
            char *fs_spec;          /* block device name */
            char *fs_file;          /* mount point */
            char *fs_vfstype;       /* filesystem type */
            char *fs_mntops;        /* mount options */
            const char *fs_type;    /* rw/rq/ro/sw/xx option */
            int fs_freq;            /* dump frequency, in days */
            int fs_passno;          /* pass number on parallel dump */
       };
       Here  the field fs_type contains (on a *BSD system) one of
       the five strings "rw", "rq", "ro", "sw", "xx" (read-write,
       read-write with quotas, read-only, swap, ignore).

       The  function  setfsent() opens the file when required and
       positions it at the first line.

       The function getfsent() parses  the  next  line  from  the
       file.  (After opening it when required.)

       The function endfsent() closes the file when required.

       The  function getfsspec() searches the file from the start
       and returns the first entry found for  which  the  fs_spec
       field matches the special_file argument.

       The  function getfsfile() searches the file from the start
       and returns the first entry found for  which  the  fs_file
       field matches the mount_point argument.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  success,  the functions getfsent(), getfsfile(), and
       getfsspec() return a pointer  to  a  struct  fstab,  while
       setfsent()  returns 1.  Upon failure or end-of-file, these
       functions return NULL and 0, respectively.

HISTORY
       The getfsent() function appeared in 4.0BSD; the other four
       functions appeared in 4.3BSD.

CONFORMING TO
       These  functions  are  not  in  POSIX.  Several  operating
       systems have them, e.g., *BSD, SunOS,  Digital  Unix,  AIX
       (which  also  has  a getfstype()).  HP-UX has functions of
       the same  names,  that  however  use  a  struct  checklist
       instead of a struct fstab, and calls these functions obso­
       lete, superseded by getmntent(3).

NOTES
       These functions are not thread-safe.

       Since Linux allows mounting a block special device in sev­
       eral  places,  and since several devices can have the same
       mount point, where the last  device  with  a  given  mount
       point  is the interesting one, while getfsfile() and getf­
       sspec() only return the first occurrence, these two  func­
       tions are not suitable for use under Linux.
