       SSL_clear is used to prepare an SSL object for a new
       connection. While all settings are kept, a side effect is
       the handling of the current SSL session.  If a session is
       still ooppeenn, it is considered bad and will be removed from
       the session cache, as required by RFC2246. A session is
       considered open, if SSL_shutdown(3) was not called for the
       connection or at least SSL_set_shutdown(3) was used to set
       the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state.
