       SSL_get_peer_certificate() returns a pointer to the X509
       certificate the peer presented. If the peer did not
       present a certificate, NULL is returned.

       Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will
       always send a certificate, if present. A client will only
       send a certificate when explicitly requested to do so by
       the server (see SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)). If an anonymous
       cipher is used, no certificates are sent.

       That a certificate is returned does not indicate
       information about the verification state, use
       SSL_get_verify_result(3) to check the verification state.

       The reference count of the X509 object is incremented by
       one, so that it will not be destroyed when the session
       containing the peer certificate is freed. The X509 object
       must be explicitly freed using X509_free().

       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no
           connection was established.

       Pointer to an X509 certificate
           The return value points to the certificate presented
           by the peer.
