DESCRIPTION
       The  function  returns 365 for a normal year and 366 for a
       leap year.  The calculation for leap year is based on:

       (year) %4 == 0 && ((year) %100 != 0 || (year) %400 == 0)

       The formula is defined in the  macro  __isleap(year)  also
       found in <time.h>.

CONFORMING TO
       This function occurs in SunOS 4.x.

NOTES
       This  is  a  compatibility function only.  Don't use it in
       new programs.  The SCO version  of  this  function  had  a
       year-2000 problem.
