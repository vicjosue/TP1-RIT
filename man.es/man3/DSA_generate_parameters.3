       DSA_generate_parameters() generates primes p and q and a
       generator g for use in the DSA.

       bbiittss is the length of the prime to be generated; the DSS
       allows a maximum of 1024 bits.

       If sseeeedd is NNUULLLL or sseeeedd_lleenn < 20, the primes will be
       generated at random. Otherwise, the seed is used to
       generate them. If the given seed does not yield a prime q,
       a new random seed is chosen and placed at sseeeedd.

       DSA_generate_parameters() places the iteration count in
       *ccoouunntteerr_rreett and a counter used for finding a generator in
       *hh_rreett, unless these are NNUULLLL.

       A callback function may be used to provide feedback about
       the progress of the key generation. If ccaallllbbaacckk is not
       NNUULLLL, it will be called as follows:

          When a candidate for q is generated, ccaallllbbaacckk((00,, mm++++,,
           ccbb_aarrgg)) is called (m is 0 for the first candidate).

          When a candidate for q has passed a test by trial
           division, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, --11,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is called.  While a
           candidate for q is tested by Miller-Rabin primality
           tests, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ii,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is called in the outer
           loop (once for each witness that confirms that the
           candidate may be prime); i is the loop counter
           (starting at 0).

          When a prime q has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((22,, 00,, ccbb_aarrgg))
           and ccaallllbbaacckk((33,, 00,, ccbb_aarrgg)) are called.

          Before a candidate for p (other than the first) is
           generated and tested, ccaallllbbaacckk((00,, ccoouunntteerr,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is
           called.

          When a candidate for p has passed the test by trial
           division, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, --11,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is called.  While it
           is tested by the Miller-Rabin primality test,
           ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ii,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is called in the outer loop
           (once for each witness that confirms that the
           candidate may be prime).  i is the loop counter
           (starting at 0).

          When p has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((22,, 11,, ccbb_aarrgg)) is
           called.

          When the generator has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((33,, 11,,
           ccbb_aarrgg)) is called.

       DSA_generate_parameters() returns a pointer to the DSA
       structure, or NNUULLLL if the parameter generation fails. The
       error codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       DSA_generate_parameters() appeared in SSLeay 0.8. The
       ccbb_aarrgg argument was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.  In versions up
       to OpenSSL 0.9.4, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ......)) was called in the inner
       loop of the Miller-Rabin test whenever it reached the
       squaring step (the parameters to ccaallllbbaacckk did not reveal
       how many witnesses had been tested); since OpenSSL 0.9.5,
       ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ......))  is called as in BN_is_prime(3), i.e.
       once for each witness.  =cut
