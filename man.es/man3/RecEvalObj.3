NAME
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj - save command on history list before
       evaluating

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(interp, cmdPtr, flags)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp   *interp    (in)      Tcl interpreter in which
                                         to evaluate command.

       Tcl_Obj      *cmdPtr    (in)      Points  to  a Tcl object
                                         containing a command (or
                                         sequence of commands) to
                                         execute.

       int          flags      (in)      An OR'ed combination  of
                                         flag  bits.  TCL_NO_EVAL
                                         means record the command
                                         but  don't  evaluate it.
                                         TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL    means
                                         evaluate  the command at
                                         global level instead  of
                                         the current stack level.

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj is invoked to record a command as  an
       event  on  the  history  list  and  then  execute it using
       Tcl_EvalObjEx (or Tcl_GlobalEvalObj if the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL
       bit  is  set in flags).  It returns a completion code such
       as TCL_OK just like Tcl_EvalObjEx, as  well  as  a  result
       object  containing  additional information (a result value
       or error message) that can be retrieved  using  Tcl_GetOb­
       jResult.   If  you  don't want the command recorded on the
       history list then you should invoke Tcl_EvalObjEx  instead
       of Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj.  Normally Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj is
       only called with top-level commands  typed  by  the  user,
       since  the  purpose of history is to allow the user to re-
       issue recently-invoked commands.  If  the  flags  argument
       contains  the TCL_NO_EVAL bit then the command is recorded
       without being evaluated.
