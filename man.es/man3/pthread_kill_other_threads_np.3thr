PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP(3) PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np  -  terminate all threads in
       program except calling thread


SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);


DESCRIPTION
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np  is  a  non-portable  Linux­
       Threads  extension.   It causes all threads in the program
       to terminate immediately, except the calling thread  which
       proceeds normally. It is intended to be called just before
       a thread calls one of the exec functions, e.g.  execve(2).

       Termination  of the other threads is not performed through
       pthread_cancel(3) and completely bypasses the cancellation
       mechanism.  Hence,  the  current settings for cancellation
       state and cancellation type are ignored, and  the  cleanup
       handlers are not executed in the terminated threads.

BUGS
       According to POSIX 1003.1c, a successful exec* in  one  of
       the  threads  should  terminate  automatically  all  other
       threads in the program.  This behavior is not  yet  imple­
       mented          in          LinuxThreads.          Calling
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np before exec*  achieves  much
       of  the  same  behavior,  except  that if exec* ultimately
       fails, then all other threads are already killed.
