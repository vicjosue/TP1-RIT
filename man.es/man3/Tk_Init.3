DESCRIPTION
       Tk_Init  is  the  package initialization procedure for Tk.
       It is normally invoked by the Tcl_AppInit procedure for an
       application  or  by the load command.  Tk_Init adds all of
       Tk's commands to interp and creates a new Tk  application,
       including  its main window.  If the initialization is suc­
       cessful Tk_Init returns TCL_OK;  if there is an  error  it
       returns  TCL_ERROR.  Tk_Init also leaves a result or error
       message in interp->result.

       If there is a variable argv in interp, Tk_Init treats  the
       contents of this variable as a list of options for the new
       Tk application.  The options may have  any  of  the  forms
       documented  for  the  wish application (in fact, wish uses
       Tk_Init to process its command-line arguments).

       Tk_SafeInit is identical to Tk_Init except that it removes
       all  Tk  commands  that are considered unsafe.  Those com­
       mands and the reasons for their exclusion are:

       bell   Continuous ringing of the bell is a nuisance.

       clipboard
              A malicious script could replace  the  contents  of
              the clipboard with the string "rm -r *" and lead to
              surprises when the contents of  the  clipboard  are
              pasted.

       grab   Grab  can  be used to block the user from using any
              other applications.

       menu   Menus can be used to cover the entire screen and to
              steal input from the user.

       selection
              See clipboard.

       send   Send  can  be  used to cause unsafe interpreters to
              execute commands.

       tk     The tk command recreates the send command, which is
              unsafe.

       tkwait Tkwait can block the containing process forever

       toplevel
              Toplevels  can  be  used to cover the entire screen
              and to steal input from the user.

       wm     If toplevels are ever allowed, wm can  be  used  to
              remove decorations, move windows around, etc.
