DESCRIPTION
       This procedure may be invoked to announce that  a  package
       has  been  linked  statically  with a Tcl application and,
       optionally, that it has already been loaded into an inter­
       preter.   Once  Tcl_StaticPackage  has  been invoked for a
       package, it may be loaded into interpreters using the load
       command.   Tcl_StaticPackage  is  normally invoked only by
       the Tcl_AppInit procedure  for  the  application,  not  by
       packages  for themselves (Tcl_StaticPackage should only be
       invoked for statically loaded packages, and  code  in  the
       package itself should not need to know whether the package
       is dynamically or statically loaded).

       When the load command is used later to  load  the  package
       into an interpreter, one of initProc and safeInitProc will
       be invoked, depending on whether the target interpreter is
       safe  or  not.   initProc and safeInitProc must both match
       the following prototype:
              typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);
       The interp argument identifies the  interpreter  in  which
       the package is to be loaded.  The initialization procedure
       must return TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR to indicate whether or not
       it  completed  successfully;  in  the event of an error it
       should set the interpreter's result to point to  an  error
       message.  The result or error from the initialization pro­
       cedure will be returned as the result of the load  command
       that caused the initialization procedure to be invoked.
