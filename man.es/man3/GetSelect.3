DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetSelection retrieves the selection specified  by  the
       atom  selection  in  the  format specified by target.  The
       selection may actually be retrieved in several pieces;  as
       each  piece  is  retrieved,  proc is called to process the
       piece.  Proc should have arguments and result  that  match
       the type Tk_GetSelProc:
              typedef int Tk_GetSelProc(
                ClientData clientData,
                Tcl_Interp *interp,
                char *portion);
       The  clientData  and  interp  parameters  to  proc will be
       copies of the corresponding arguments to  Tk_GetSelection.
       Portion  will  be a pointer to a string containing part or
       all of the selection.  For large selections, proc will  be
       called  several  times  with  successive  portions  of the
       selection.  The X Inter-Client  Communication  Conventions
       Manual  allows a selection to be returned in formats other
       than strings, e.g. as an array of atoms or  integers.   If
       this happens, Tk converts the selection back into a string
       before calling proc.  If a selection  is  returned  as  an
       array  of atoms, Tk converts it to a string containing the
       atom names separated by white space.  For any other format
       besides  string,  Tk converts a selection to a string con­
       taining hexadecimal values separated by white space.

       Tk_GetSelection returns to its caller when  the  selection
       has  been  completely  retrieved and processed by proc, or
       when a fatal error has occurred (e.g. the selection  owner
       didn't   respond   promptly).    Tk_GetSelection  normally
       returns TCL_OK;  if an error occurs, it returns  TCL_ERROR
       and  leaves  an  error  message  in  interp->result.  Proc
       should also return either TCL_OK  or  TCL_ERROR.  If  proc
       encounters  an  error  in  dealing  with the selection, it
       should leave an error message in interp->result and return
       TCL_ERROR;  this will abort the selection retrieval.
