DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_CallWhenDeleted  arranges  for  proc  to  be called by
       Tcl_DeleteInterp if/when interp is deleted at some  future
       time.  Proc will be invoked just before the interpreter is
       deleted, but the interpreter will still be  valid  at  the
       time  of  the call.  Proc should have arguments and result
       that match the type Tcl_InterpDeleteProc:
              typedef void Tcl_InterpDeleteProc(
                ClientData clientData,
                Tcl_Interp *interp);
       The clientData and interp parameters  are  copies  of  the
       clientData  and  interp  arguments  given to Tcl_CallWhen­
       Deleted.  Typically, clientData points to an  application-
       specific  data structure that proc uses to perform cleanup
       when an interpreter is about to go away.   Proc  does  not
       return a value.

       Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted   cancels   a   previous  call  to
       Tcl_CallWhenDeleted with the same arguments, so that  proc
       won't  be  called  after  all  when interp is deleted.  If
       there is no deletion callback that matches  interp,  proc,
       and  clientData  then  the call to Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted
       has no effect.
