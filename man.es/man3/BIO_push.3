BIO_push(3)                  OpenSSL                  BIO_push(3)



NNAAMMEE
       BIO_push, BIO_pop - add and remove BIOs from a chain.

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        BIO *  BIO_push(BIO *b,BIO *append);
        BIO *  BIO_pop(BIO *b);


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The BIO_push() function appends the BIO aappppeenndd to bb, it
       returns bb.

       BIO_pop() removes the BIO bb from a chain and returns the
       next BIO in the chain, or NULL if there is no next BIO.
       The removed BIO then becomes a single BIO with no
       association with the original chain, it can thus be freed
       or attached to a different chain.

NNOOTTEESS
       The names of these functions are perhaps a little
       misleading. BIO_push() joins two BIO chains whereas
       BIO_pop() deletes a single BIO from a chain, the deleted
       BIO does not need to be at the end of a chain.

       The process of calling BIO_push() and BIO_pop() on a BIO
       may have additional consequences (a control call is made
       to the affected BIOs) any effects will be noted in the
       descriptions of individual BIOs.

       For these examples suppose mmdd11 and mmdd22 are digest BIOs,
       bb6644 is a base64 BIO and ff is a file BIO.

       If the call:

        BIO_push(b64, f);

       is made then the new chain will be bb6644--cchhaaiinn. After making
       the calls

        BIO_push(md2, b64);
        BIO_push(md1, md2);

       the new chain is mmdd11--mmdd22--bb6644--ff. Data written to mmdd11 will
       be digested by mmdd11 and mmdd22, bbaassee6644 encoded and written to
       ff.

       It should be noted that reading causes data to pass in the
       reverse direction, that is data is read from ff, base64
       ddeeccooddeedd and digested by mmdd11 and mmdd22. If the call:

        BIO_pop(md2);

       The call will return bb6644 and the new chain will be
       mmdd11--bb6644--ff data can be written to mmdd11 as before.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       BIO_push() returns the end of the chain, bb.

       BIO_pop() returns the next BIO in the chain, or NULL if
       there is no next BIO.
