PUTWCHAR(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual         PUTWCHAR(3)



NAME
       putwchar - write a wide character to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwchar(wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  putwchar function is the wide-character equivalent of
       the putchar function. It writes the wide character  wc  to
       stdout.   If ferror(stdout) becomes true, it returns WEOF.
       If a wide character conversion error occurs, it sets errno
       to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Otherwise it returns wc.

       For a non-locking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  putwchar function returns wc if no error occurred, or
       WEOF to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98

NOTES
       The behaviour of putwchar depends on the LC_CTYPE category
       of the current locale.

       It  is  reasonable  to  expect that putwchar will actually
       write the multibyte sequence  corresponding  to  the  wide
       character wc.
