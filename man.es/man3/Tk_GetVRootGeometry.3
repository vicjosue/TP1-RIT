NAME
       Tk_GetVRootGeometry  -  Get  location  and size of virtual
       root for window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Tk_GetVRootGeometry(tkwin, xPtr, yPtr, widthPtr, heightPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window   tkwin       (in)      Token for  window  whose
                                         virtual  root  is  to be
                                         queried.

       int         xPtr        (out)     Points to word in  which
                                         to   store  x-offset  of
                                         virtual root.

       int         yPtr        (out)     Points to word in  which
                                         to   store  y-offset  of
                                         virtual root.

       int         widthPtr    (out)     Points to word in  which
                                         to  store  width of vir­
                                         tual root.

       int         heightPtr   (out)     Points to word in  which
                                         to  store height of vir­
                                         tual root.

DESCRIPTION
       TkGetVRootGeometry returns geometry information about  the
       virtual  root window associated with tkwin.  The ``associ­
       ated'' virtual root is the one in  which  tkwin's  nearest
       top-level  ancestor  (or tkwin itself if it is a top-level
       window) has been reparented by the window  manager.   This
       window is identified by a __SWM_ROOT or __WM_ROOT property
       placed on the top-level window by the window manager.   If
       tkwin is not associated with a virtual root (e.g.  because
       the window manager doesn't use virtual roots)  then  *xPtr
       and  *yPtr  will  be set to 0 and *widthPtr and *heightPtr
       will be set to the dimensions  of  the  screen  containing
       tkwin.
