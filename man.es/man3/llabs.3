ABS(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual              ABS(3)



NAME
       abs,  labs, llabs, imaxabs - compute the absolute value of
       an integer.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int abs(int j);
       long int labs(long int j);
       long long int llabs(long long int j);

       #include <inttypes.h>

       intmax_t imaxabs(intmax_t j);

DESCRIPTION
       The abs() function computes  the  absolute  value  of  the
       integer  argument  j.   The  labs(), llabs() and imaxabs()
       functions compute the absolute value of the argument j  of
       the appropriate integer type for the function.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the absolute value of the integer argument, of the
       appropriate integer type for the function.

CONFORMING TO
       SVID 3, POSIX.1, BSD 4.3,  ISO/IEC  9899  (C99).   POSIX.1
       (1996  edition) only requires the abs() function.  ISO/IEC
       9899:1990 (C89) only includes the abs() and  labs()  func­
       tions;  the  functions llabs() and imaxabs() were added in
       C99.

NOTES
       Trying to take the absolute value  of  the  most  negative
       integer is not defined.

       The  llabs()  function  is included in glibc since version
       2.0, but is not in libc5 or libc4.  The imaxabs() function
       is included in glibc since version 2.1.1.

       For  llabs() to be declared, it may be necessary to define
       _ISOC99_SOURCE or _ISOC9X_SOURCE (depending on the version
       of glibc) before including any standard headers.

       GCC  handles  abs()  and labs() as builtin functions.  GCC
       3.0 also handles llabs() and imaxabs() as builtins.
