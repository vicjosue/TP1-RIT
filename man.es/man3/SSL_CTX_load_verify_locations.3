       SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() specifies the locations
       for ccttxx, at which CA certificates for verification
       purposes are located. The certificates available via
       CCAAffiillee and CCAAppaatthh are trusted.

NNOOTTEESS
       If CCAAffiillee is not NULL, it points to a file of CA
       certificates in PEM format. The file can contain several
       CA certificates identified by

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... (CA certificate in base64 encoding) ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       sequences. Before, between, and after the certificates
       text is allowed which can be used e.g. for descriptions of
       the certificates.

       The CCAAffiillee is processed on execution of the
       SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() function.

       If CCAAppaatthh is not NULL, it points to a directory containing
       CA certificates in PEM format. The files each contain one
       CA certificate. The files are looked up by the CA subject
       name hash value, which must hence be available.  If more
       than one CA certificate with the same name hash value
       exist, the extension must be different (e.g. 9d66eef0.0,
       9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the ordering
       of the extension number, regardless of other properties of
       the certificates.  Use the cc_rreehhaasshh utility to create the
       necessary links.

       The certificates in CCAAppaatthh are only looked up when
       required, e.g. when building the certificate chain or when
       actually performing the verification of a peer
       certificate.

       When looking up CA certificates, the OpenSSL library will
       first search the certificates in CCAAffiillee, then those in
       CCAAppaatthh. Certificate matching is done based on the subject
       name, the key identifier (if present), and the serial
       number as taken from the certificate to be verified. If
       these data do not match, the next certificate will be
       tried. If a first certificate matching the parameters is
       found, the verification process will be performed; no
       other certificates for the same parameters will be
       searched in case of failure.

       In server mode, when requesting a client certificate, the
       server must send the list of CAs of which it will accept
       client certificates. This list is not influenced by the
       contents of CCAAffiillee or CCAAppaatthh and must explicitly be set
       using the SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3) family of
       functions.

       When building its own certificate chain, an OpenSSL
       client/server will try to fill in missing certificates
       from CCAAffiillee/CCAAppaatthh, if the certificate chain was not
       explicitly specified (see SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert(3),
       SSL_CTX_use_certificate(3).

WWAARRNNIINNGGSS
       If several CA certificates matching the name, key
       identifier, and serial number condition are available,
       only the first one will be examined. This may lead to
       unexpected results if the same CA certificate is available
       with different expiration dates. If a "certificate
       expired" verification error occurs, no other certificate
       will be searched. Make sure to not have expired
       certificates mixed with valid ones.

       Generate a CA certificate file with descriptive text from
       the CA certificates ca1.pem ca2.pem ca3.pem:

        #!/bin/sh
        rm CAfile.pem
        for i in ca1.pem ca2.pem ca3.pem ; do
          openssl x509 -in $i -text >> CAfile.pem
        done

       Prepare the directory /some/where/certs containing several
       CA certificates for use as CCAAppaatthh:

        cd /some/where/certs
        c_rehash .

       The following return values can occur:

       0   The operation failed because CCAAffiillee and CCAAppaatthh are
           NULL or the processing at one of the locations
           specified failed. Check the error stack to find out
           the reason.

       1   The operation succeeded.
