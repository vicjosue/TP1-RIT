DESCRIPTION
       Tk_ClearSelection cancels the selection specified  by  the
       atom  selection  for  the  display  containing tkwin.  The
       selection need not be in tkwin itself or even  in  tkwin's
       application.   If  there  is  a window anywhere on tkwin's
       display that owns selection, the window will  be  notified
       and  the  selection will be cleared.  If there is no owner
       for selection on the display, then the  procedure  has  no
       effect.
