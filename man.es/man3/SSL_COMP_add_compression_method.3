       SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() adds the compression
       method ccmm with the identifier iidd to the list of available
       compression methods. This list is globally maintained for
       all SSL operations within this application.  It cannot be
       set for specific SSL_CTX or SSL objects.

       The TLS standard (or SSLv3) allows the integration of
       compression methods into the communication. The TLS RFC
       does however not specify compression methods or their
       corresponding identifiers, so there is currently no
       compatible way to integrate compression with unknown
       peers. It is therefore currently not recommended to
       integrate compression into applications. Applications for
       non-public use may agree on certain compression methods.
       Using different compression methods with the same
       identifier will lead to connection failure.

       An OpenSSL client speaking a protocol that allows
       compression (SSLv3, TLSv1) will unconditionally send the
       list of all compression methods enabled with
       SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() to the server during the
       handshake.  Unlike the mechanisms to set a cipher list,
       there is no method available to restrict the list of
       compression method on a per connection basis.

       An OpenSSL server will match the identifiers listed by a
       client against its own compression methods and will
       unconditionally activate compression when a matching
       identifier is found. There is no way to restrict the list
       of compression methods supported on a per connection
       basis.

       The OpenSSL library has the compression methods CCOOMMPP_rrllee(())
       and (when especially enabled during compilation)
       CCOOMMPP_zzlliibb(()) available.

       Once the identities of the compression methods for the TLS
       protocol have been standardized, the compression API will
       most likely be changed. Using it in the current state is
       not recommended.

       SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() may return the following
       values:

       1   The operation succeeded.

       0   The operation failed. Check the error queue to find
           out the reason.
