SETLOGMASK(3)       Linux Programmer's Manual       SETLOGMASK(3)



NAME
       setlogmask - set log priority mask

SYNOPSIS
       #include <syslog.h>

       int setlogmask(int mask);

DESCRIPTION
       A  process  has  a log priority mask that determines which
       calls to syslog(3) may be logged. All other calls will  be
       ignored.   Logging is enabled for the priorities that have
       the corresponding bit set in mask.  The  initial  mask  is
       such that logging is enabled for all priorities.

       The  setlogmask()  function sets this logmask for the cur­
       rent process, and returns the previous mask.  If the  mask
       argument is 0, the current logmask is not modified.

       The  eight  priorities are LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT,
       LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO and  LOG_DEBUG.
       The  bit  corresponding  to  a  priority p is LOG_MASK(p).
       Some systems also provide a macro LOG_UPTO(p) for the mask
       of all priorities in the above list up to and including p.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns the previous log priority mask.

ERRORS
       None.

CONFORMING TO
       XPG4.  Note that the description in POSIX  1003.1-2001  is
       flawed.
