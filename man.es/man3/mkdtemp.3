MKDTEMP(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          MKDTEMP(3)



NAME
       mkdtemp - create a unique temporary directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *mkdtemp(char *template);

DESCRIPTION
       The  mkdtemp()  function generates a uniquely-named tempo­
       rary directory from template. The last six  characters  of
       template  must  be  XXXXXX  and  these are replaced with a
       string that makes the directory name unique. The directory
       is  then  created with permissions 0700.  Since it will be
       modified, template must not  be  a  string  constant,  but
       should be declared as a character array.

RETURN VALUE
       The  mkdtemp()  function returns a pointer to the modified
       template string on success, and NULL on failure, in  which
       case errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The  last  six  characters  of  template  were  not
              XXXXXX.  Now template is unchanged.


       Also see mkdir(2) for other possible values for errno.
