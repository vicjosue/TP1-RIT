       BIO_f_null() returns the null filter BIO method. This is a
       filter BIO that does nothing.

       All requests to a null filter BIO are passed through to
       the next BIO in the chain: this means that a BIO chain
       containing a null filter BIO behaves just as though the
       BIO was not there.

NNOOTTEESS
       As may be apparent a null filter BIO is not particularly
       useful.
