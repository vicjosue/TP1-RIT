NAME
       Tk_SetGrid,  Tk_UnsetGrid  - control the grid for interac­
       tive resizing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Tk_SetGrid(tkwin, reqWidth, reqHeight, widthInc, heightInc)

       Tk_UnsetGrid(tkwin)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window   tkwin       (in)      Token for window.

       int         reqWidth    (in)      Width in grid units that
                                         corresponds to the pixel
                                         dimension   tkwin    has
                                         requested  via Tk_Geome­
                                         tryRequest.

       int         reqHeight   (in)      Height  in  grid   units
                                         that  corresponds to the
                                         pixel  dimension   tkwin
                                         has     requested    via
                                         Tk_GeometryRequest.

       int         widthInc    (in)      Width of one grid  unit,
                                         in pixels.

       int         heightInc   (in)      Height of one grid unit,
                                         in pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_SetGrid  turns  on  gridded  geometry  management   for
       tkwin's  toplevel window and specifies the geometry of the
       grid.  Tk_SetGrid is typically invoked by  a  widget  when
       its  setGrid  option  is  true.   It restricts interactive
       resizing of tkwin's toplevel  window  so  that  the  space
       allocated  to  the toplevel is equal to its requested size
       plus or minus even multiples of  widthInc  and  heightInc.
       Furthermore,  the reqWidth and reqHeight values are passed
       to the window manager so that it can report  the  window's
       size in grid units during interactive resizes.  If tkwin's
       configuration changes (e.g.,  the  size  of  a  grid  unit
       changes)  then  the  widget should invoke Tk_SetGrid again
       with the new information.

       Tk_UnsetGrid  cancels  gridded  geometry  management   for
       tkwin's toplevel window.

       For each toplevel window there can be at most one internal
       window with gridding enabled.  If Tk_SetGrid or  Tk_Unset­
       Grid is invoked when some other window is already control­
       ling gridding for tkwin's toplevel, the calls for the  new
       window have no effect.

       See  the  wm  manual  entry  for additional information on
       gridded geometry management.
