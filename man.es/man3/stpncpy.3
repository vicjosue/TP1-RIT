STPNCPY(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          STPNCPY(3)



NAME
       stpncpy - copy a fixed-size string, returning a pointer to
       its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *stpncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The stpncpy function copies at most n characters from  the
       string  pointed  to by src, including the terminating '\0'
       character, to the array pointed  to  by  dest.  Exactly  n
       characters  are written at dest. If the length strlen(src)
       is smaller than n, the remaining characters in  the  array
       pointed to by dest are filled with '\0' characters. If the
       length strlen(src) is greater or equal to  n,  the  string
       pointed to by dest will not be '\0' terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
       n characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       stpncpy returns a pointer to the terminating null in dest,
       or, if dest is not null-terminated, dest + n.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
