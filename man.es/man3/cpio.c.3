NAME
       lib/cpio.c - Handle cpio payloads within rpm packages.

SYNOPSIS
       #include 'system.h'
       #include <rpmlib.h>
       #include 'fsm.h'

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       Handle cpio payloads within rpm packages.



       Warning:
           FIXME: We don't translate between cpio and system mode
           bits! These should both be the same, but really odd
           things are going to happen if that's not true!

       Definition in file cpio.c.
