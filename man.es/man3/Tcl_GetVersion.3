DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_GetVersion should be used to query the version  number
       of  the Tcl library at runtime.  This is useful when using
       a dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing a  stubs-
       aware  extension.  For instance, if you write an extension
       that is linked against the Tcl stubs library, it could  be
       loaded  into  a  program linked to an older version of Tcl
       than you expected.   Use  Tcl_GetVersion  to  verify  that
       fact,  and  possibly to change the behavior of your exten­
       sion.

       If may pass a NULL for any of the arguments. For  instance
       if  you  do  not care about the patchLevel of the library,
       pass a NULL for the patchLevel argument.
