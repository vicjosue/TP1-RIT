DESCRIPTION
       This procedure returns the current value of the tk_strict­
       Motif variable in the interpreter associated with  tkwin's
       application.   The value is returned as an integer that is
       either 0 or 1.  1 means that strict Motif  compliance  has
       been  requested, so anything that is not part of the Motif
       specification should be avoided.  0  means  that  ``Motif-
       like'' is good enough, and extra features are welcome.

       This  procedure uses a link to the Tcl variable to provide
       much faster access to the variable's value than  could  be
       had by calling Tcl_GetVar.
