NAME
       lwres_getrrsetbyname,   lwres_freerrset   -  retrieve  DNS
       records

SYNOPSIS
       #include <lwres/netdb.h>

       int lwres_getrrsetbyname(const char *hostname, unsigned
       int rdclass, unsigned int rdtype, unsigned int flags,
       struct rrsetinfo **res);

       void lwres_freerrset(struct rrsetinfo *rrset);

       The following structures are used:

       struct  rdatainfo {
               unsigned int            rdi_length;     /* length of data */
               unsigned char           *rdi_data;      /* record data */
       };

       struct  rrsetinfo {
               unsigned int            rri_flags;      /* RRSET_VALIDATED... */
               unsigned int            rri_rdclass;    /* class number */
               unsigned int            rri_rdtype;     /* RR type number */
               unsigned int            rri_ttl;        /* time to live */
               unsigned int            rri_nrdatas;    /* size of rdatas array */
               unsigned int            rri_nsigs;      /* size of sigs array */
               char                    *rri_name;      /* canonical name */
               struct rdatainfo        *rri_rdatas;    /* individual records */
               struct rdatainfo        *rri_sigs;      /* individual signatures */
       };


DESCRIPTION
       lwres_getrrsetbyname() gets  a  set  of  resource  records
       associated  with a hostname, class, and type.  hostname is
       a pointer a to null-terminated string. The flags field  is
       currently unused and must be zero.

       After a successful call to lwres_getrrsetbyname(), *res is
       a pointer to an rrsetinfo structure, containing a list  of
       one  or  more  rdatainfo  structures  containing  resource
       records and potentially another list of  rdatainfo  struc­
       tures  containing  SIG  resource  records  associated with
       those records.  The members rri_rdclass and rri_rdtype are
       copied  from  the  parameters.   rri_ttl  and rri_name are
       properties of the obtained rrset.   The  resource  records
       contained  in  rri_rdatas and rri_sigs are in uncompressed
       DNS wire format.  Properties of the  rdataset  are  repre­
       sented  in  the rri_flags bitfield. If the RRSET_VALIDATED
       bit is set, the data has been  DNSSEC  validated  and  the
       signatures verified.

       All  of the information returned by lwres_getrrsetbyname()
       is dynamically  allocated:  the  rrsetinfo  and  rdatainfo
       structures, and the canonical host name strings pointed to
       by  the  rrsetinfostructure.   Memory  allocated  for  the
       dynamically  allocated  structures created by a successful
       call   to   lwres_getrrsetbyname()    is    released    by
       lwres_freerrset().   rrset  is a pointer to a struct rrset
       created by a call to lwres_getrrsetbyname().


RETURN VALUES
       lwres_getrrsetbyname() returns zero on success, and one of
       the following error codes if an error occurred:

       ERRSET_NONAME
              the name does not exist

       ERRSET_NODATA
              the  name  exists,  but  does  not have data of the
              desired type

       ERRSET_NOMEMORY
              memory could not be allocated

       ERRSET_INVAL
              a parameter is invalid

       ERRSET_FAIL
              other failure
