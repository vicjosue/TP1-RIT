DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_Main  acts  as  the  main  program  for most Tcl-based
       applications.  Starting with Tcl 7.4 it is not called main
       anymore because it is part of the Tcl library and having a
       function main in a library (particularly a shared library)
       causes  problems  on many systems.  Having main in the Tcl
       library would also make it hard to use  Tcl  in  C++  pro­
       grams, since C++ programs must have special C++ main func­
       tions.

       Normally each application contains a small  main  function
       that does nothing but invoke Tcl_Main.  Tcl_Main then does
       all the work of creating and running a tclsh-like applica­
       tion.

       When it is has finished its own initialization, but before
       it processes commands, Tcl_Main calls the procedure  given
       by  the  appInitProc  argument.  This procedure provides a
       ``hook'' for the application to perform its  own  initial­
       ization,  such  as defining application-specific commands.
       The procedure must have an interface that matches the type
       Tcl_AppInitProc:
              typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);
       AppInitProc is almost always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit; for
       more details on this procedure, see the documentation  for
       Tcl_AppInit.
