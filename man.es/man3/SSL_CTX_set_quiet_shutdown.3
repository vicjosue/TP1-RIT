       SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown"
       flag for ccttxx to be mmooddee. SSL objects created from ccttxx
       inherit the mmooddee valid at the time SSL_new(3) is called.
       mmooddee may be 0 or 1.

       SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown"
       setting of ccttxx.

       SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag
       for ssssll to be mmooddee. The setting stays valid until ssssll is
       removed with SSL_free(3) or SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() is
       called again.  It is not changed when SSL_clear(3) is
       called.  mmooddee may be 0 or 1.

       SSL_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown"
       setting of ssssll.

       Normally when a SSL connection is finished, the parties
       must send out "close notify" alert messages using
       SSL_shutdown(3) for a clean shutdown.

       When setting the "quiet shutdown" flag to 1,
       SSL_shutdown(3) will set the internal flags to
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.  (SSL_shutdown(3)
       then behaves like SSL_set_shutdown(3) called with
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.)  The session is
       thus considered to be shutdown, but no "close notify"
       alert is sent to the peer. This behaviour violates the TLS
       standard.

       The default is normal shutdown behaviour as described by
       the TLS standard.

       SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_set_quiet_shutdown()
       do not return diagnostic information.

       SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_get_quiet_shutdown
       return the current setting.
