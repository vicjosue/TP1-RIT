DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_Concat  is  a utility procedure used by several of the
       Tcl commands.  Given a collection of strings, it  concate­
       nates  them together into a single string, with the origi­
       nal strings separated by spaces.  This  procedure  behaves
       differently than Tcl_Merge, in that the arguments are sim­
       ply concatenated: no effort is made to ensure proper  list
       structure.   However,  in  most common usage the arguments
       will all be proper lists themselves;   if  this  is  true,
       then the result will also have proper list structure.

       Tcl_Concat  eliminates leading and trailing white space as
       it copies strings from argv to the result.  If an  element
       of  argv  consists  of  nothing but white space, then that
       string is ignored entirely.  This white-space removal  was
       added  to  make  the output of the concat command cleaner-
       looking.

       The  result  string   is   dynamically   allocated   using |
       Tcl_Alloc;   the  caller must eventually release the space |
       by calling Tcl_Free.                                       |
