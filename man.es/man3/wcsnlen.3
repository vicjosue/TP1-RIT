NAME
       wcsnlen  - determine the length of a fixed-size wide-char­
       acter string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcsnlen(const wchar_t *s, size_t maxlen);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsnlen function is the wide-character  equivalent  of
       the  strnlen function. It returns the number of wide-char­
       acters in the string pointed to by s,  not  including  the
       terminating  L'\0' character, but at most maxlen. In doing
       this, wcsnlen looks only at the first maxlen  wide-charac­
       ters at s and never beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsnlen  function  returns wcslen(s), if that is less
       than maxlen, or maxlen if  there  is  no  L'\0'  character
       among the first maxlen wide characters pointed to by s.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.
