       char *
       Tcl_GetCwd(interp, bufferPtr)

       int
       Tcl_Chdir(path)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp    *interp      (in)      Interpreter in  which
                                            to  report  an error,
                                            if any.

       Tcl_DString   *bufferPtr   (in/out)  This  dynamic  string
                                            is  used to store the

                                            directory.    At  the

                                            free   up    anything
                                            stored here.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures may be used  to  manipulate  the  current
       working  directory  for  the  application.   They  provide
       C-level access to the same functionality as  the  Tcl  pwd
       command.

       Tcl_GetCwd  returns  a  pointer to a string specifying the
       current directory, or NULL if the current directory  could
       not  be determined.  If NULL is returned, an error message
       is left in the interp's result.  Storage  for  the  result
       string  is  allocated  in  bufferPtr; the caller must call
       Tcl_DStringFree() when the result  is  no  longer  needed.
       The format of the path is UTF-8.

       Tcl_Chdir  changes the applications current working direc­
       tory to the value specified in path.  The  format  of  the
       passed  in  string must be UTF-8.  The function returns -1
       on error or 0 on success.
