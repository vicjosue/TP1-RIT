SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Colormap
       Tk_GetColormap(interp, tkwin, string)

       Tk_FreeColormap(display, colormap)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp    (in)      Interpreter  to  use   for

       Tk_Window  tkwin      (in)      Token  for window in which
                                       colormap will be used.

       char       *string    (in)      Selects    a     colormap:
                                       either  new or the name of
                                       a  window  with  the  same
                                       screen   and   visual   as

       Colormap   colormap   (in)      Colormap  to  free;   must
                                       have been  returned  by  a
                                       previous  call  to Tk_Get­
                                       Colormap or  Tk_GetVisual.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures are used to manage colormaps.  Tk_GetCol­
       ormap returns a colormap suitable for use  in  tkwin.   If
       its string argument is new then a new colormap is created;
       otherwise string must be the name of another  window  with
       the same screen and visual as tkwin, and the colormap from
       that window is returned.  If string doesn't make sense, or
       if  it refers to a window on a different screen from tkwin
       or with a different visual than tkwin, then Tk_GetColormap
       returns    None   and   leaves   an   error   message   in
       interp->result.

       Tk_FreeColormap should be called when a colormap  returned
       by  Tk_GetColormap  is  no  longer needed.  Tk maintains a
       reference count for each colormap returned  by  Tk_GetCol­
       ormap,  so there should eventually be one call to Tk_Free­
       Colormap for each call to  Tk_GetColormap.   When  a  col­
       ormap's  reference  count  becomes zero, Tk releases the X
       colormap.

       Tk_GetVisual and Tk_GetColormap work together, in  that  a
       new colormap created by Tk_GetVisual may later be returned
       by Tk_GetColormap.  The reference counting  mechanism  for
       colormaps   includes   both   procedures,  so  callers  of
       Tk_GetVisual must also call Tk_FreeColormap to release the
       colormap.  If Tk_GetColormap is called with a string value
       of new then the resulting colormap will never be  returned
       by Tk_GetVisual;  however, it can be used in other windows
       by calling Tk_GetColormap with the original window's  name
       as string.
