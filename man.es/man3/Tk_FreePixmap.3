SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Pixmap
       Tk_GetPixmap(display, d, width, height, depth)

       Tk_FreePixmap(display, pixmap)

ARGUMENTS

       Drawable   d           (in)      Pixmap  or  window  where
                                        the  new  pixmap  will be
                                        used for drawing.

       int        width       (in)      Width of pixmap.

       int        depth       (in)      Number of bits per  pixel
                                        in pixmap.

DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures  are  identical  to  the Xlib procedures
       XCreatePixmap and XFreePixmap, except that they have extra
       code  to manage X resource identifiers so that identifiers
       for deleted pixmaps can be reused in the  future.   It  is
       important  for  Tk  applications  to  use these procedures
       rather  than  XCreatePixmap  and  XFreePixmap;   otherwise
       long-running  applications may run out of resource identi­
       fiers.

       Tk_GetPixmap creates a pixmap suitable for drawing  in  d,
       with  dimensions  given  by  width, height, and depth, and
       returns its identifier.  Tk_FreePixmap destroys the pixmap
       given  by  pixmap and makes its resource identifier avail­
       able for reuse.
