       SSL_want() returns state information for the SSL object
       ssssll.

       The other SSL_want_*() calls are shortcuts for the
       possible states returned by SSL_want().

NNOOTTEESS
       SSL_want() examines the internal state information of the
       SSL object. Its return values are similar to that of
       SSL_get_error(3).  Unlike SSL_get_error(3), which also
       evaluates the error queue, the results are obtained by
       examining an internal state flag only. The information
       must therefore only be used for normal operation under
       non-blocking I/O. Error conditions are not handled and
       must be treated using SSL_get_error(3).

       The result returned by SSL_want() should always be
       consistent with the result of SSL_get_error(3).

       The following return values can currently occur for
       SSL_want():

       SSL_NOTHING
           There is no data to be written or to be read.

       SSL_WRITING
           There are data in the SSL buffer that must be written
           to the underlying BBIIOO layer in order to complete the
           actual SSL_*() operation.  A call to SSL_get_error(3)
           should return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.

       SSL_READING
           More data must be read from the underlying BBIIOO layer
           in order to complete the actual SSL_*() operation.  A
           call to SSL_get_error(3) should return
           SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ.

       SSL_X509_LOOKUP
           The operation did not complete because an application
           callback set by SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb() has asked
           to be called again.  A call to SSL_get_error(3) should
           return SSL_ERROR_WANT_X509_LOOKUP.

       SSL_want_nothing(), SSL_want_read(), SSL_want_write(),
       SSL_want_x509_lookup() return 1, when the corresponding
       condition is true or 0 otherwise.
