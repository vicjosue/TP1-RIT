NAME
       mbsrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide character
       string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char **src,
                         size_t len, mbstate_t *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       If dest is not a NULL pointer, the mbsrtowcs function con­
       verts the multibyte string *src to a wide-character string
       starting at dest.  At most len wide characters are written
       to dest. The shift state *ps is updated. The conversion is
       effectively   performed   by   repeatedly   calling   mbr­
       towc(dest,*src,n,ps)  where  n is some positive number, as
       long as this call succeeds, and then incrementing dest  by
       one  and *src by the number of bytes consumed. The conver­
       sion can stop for three reasons:

       1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In
       this  case  *src is left pointing to the invalid multibyte
       sequence, (size_t)(-1) is returned, and errno  is  set  to
       EILSEQ.

       2. len non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at dest.
       In this case *src is left pointing to the  next  multibyte
       sequence  to  be converted, and the number of wide charac­
       ters written to dest is returned.

       3. The multibyte string  has  been  completely  converted,
       including  the terminating '\0' (which has the side effect
       of bringing back *ps to the initial state). In  this  case
       *src  is  set  to  NULL, and the number of wide characters
       written to dest, excluding the terminating  L'\0'  charac­
       ter, is returned.

       If  dest  is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion pro­
       ceeds as above, except that the converted wide  characters
       are  not  written  out to memory, and that no length limit
       exists.

       In both of the above cases, if ps is  a  NULL  pointer,  a
       static  anonymous  state only known to the mbsrtowcs func­
       tion is used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
       len wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The  mbsrtowcs function returns the number of wide charac­
       ters that make up the converted part of the wide character
       string, not including the terminating null wide character.
       If  an  invalid  multibyte   sequence   was   encountered,
       (size_t)(-1) is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

NOTES
       The  behaviour  of mbsrtowcs depends on the LC_CTYPE cate­
       gory of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multi-thread safe.
