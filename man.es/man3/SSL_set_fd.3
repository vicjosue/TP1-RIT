       SSL_set_fd() sets the file descriptor ffdd as the
       input/output facility for the TLS/SSL (encrypted) side of
       ssssll. ffdd will typically be the socket file descriptor of a
       network connection.

       When performing the operation, a ssoocckkeett BBIIOO is
       automatically created to interface between the ssssll and ffdd.
       The BIO and hence the SSL engine inherit the behaviour of
       ffdd. If ffdd is non-blocking, the ssssll will also have non-
       blocking behaviour.

       If there was already a BIO connected to ssssll, BIO_free()
       will be called (for both the reading and writing side, if
       different).

       SSL_set_rfd() and SSL_set_wfd() perform the respective
       action, but only for the read channel or the write
       channel, which can be set independently.

       The following return values can occur:

       0   The operation failed. Check the error stack to find
           out why.

       1   The operation succeeded.
