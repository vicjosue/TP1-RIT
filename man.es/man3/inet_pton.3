NAME
       inet_pton - Create a network address structure

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <arpa/inet.h>

       int inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  converts  the  character string src into a
       network address structure in the af address  family,  then
       copies the network address structure to dst.

       inet_pton(3)  extends the inet_addr(3) function to support
       multiple address families, inet_addr(3) is now  considered
       to  be deprecated in favor of inet_pton(3).  The following
       address families are currently supported:

       AF_INET
              src points to a character string containing an IPv4
              network   address   in   the   dotted-quad  format,
              "ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd".  The address is converted  to  a
              struct  in_addr  and  copied  to dst, which must be
              sizeof(struct in_addr) bytes long.

       AF_INET6
              src points to a character string containing an IPv6
              network address in any allowed IPv6 address format.
              The address is converted to a struct  in6_addr  and
              copied   to   dst,   which  must  be  sizeof(struct
              in6_addr) bytes long.

       Certain legacy hex and octal formats of AF_INET  addresses
       are not supported by inet_pton, which rejects them.

RETURN VALUE
       inet_pton  returns  a  negative  value  and  sets errno to
       EAFNOSUPPORT if af does not contain a valid  address  fam­
       ily.   0  is  returned if src does not contain a character
       string representing a valid network address in the  speci­
       fied  address family.  A positive value is returned if the
       network address was successfully converted.

BUGS
       AF_INET6 does not recognize IPv4 addresses.   An  explicit
       IPv6-mapped  IPv4 address must be supplied in src instead.
