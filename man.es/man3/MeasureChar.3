ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Font      tkfont      (in)      Token for font in which
                                          text is to be drawn  or
                                          measured.    Must  have
                                          been returned by a pre­

DESCRIPTION
       These  routines  are  for  measuring and displaying simple
       single-font, single-line, strings.  To measure and display
       single-font, multi-line, justified text, refer to the doc­
       umentation for Tk_ComputeTextLayout.  There is no program­
       ming interface in the core of Tk that supports multi-font,
       multi-line text; support for that behavior must  be  built
       on  top  of  simpler  layers.   Note  that  the interfaces |
       described here are byte-oriented  not  character-oriented, |
       so  index  values  coming from Tcl scripts need to be con­ |
       verted  to  byte  offsets  using  the  Tcl_UtfAtIndex  and |
       related routines.

       A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number, or
       some other symbol.  Not all character  codes  in  a  given
       font   have  a  glyph.   Characters  such  as  tabs,  new­
       lines/returns, and control characters that have  no  glyph
       are  measured and displayed by these procedures in a plat­
       form-dependent manner; under X,  they  are  replaced  with
       backslashed escape sequences, while under Windows and Mac­
       intosh hollow or solid boxes may be substituted.  Refer to
       the  documentation for Tk_ComputeTextLayout for a program­
       ming  interface  that  supports  the  platform-independent
       expansion   of   tab  characters  into  columns  and  new­
       lines/returns into multi-line text.

       Tk_MeasureChars is used both to compute the  length  of  a
       given  string  and  to  compute how many characters from a
       string fit in a given amount of space.  The  return  value
       is  the  number of bytes from string that fit in the space
       specified by maxPixels subject to the conditions described
       by flags.  If all characters fit, the return value will be
       numBytes.  *lengthPtr is filled with the  computed  width,
       in pixels, of the portion of the string that was measured.
       For example, if the return value is 5, then *lengthPtr  is
       filled   with  the  distance  between  the  left  edge  of
       string[0] and the right edge of string[4].

       Tk_TextWidth is a wrapper function that provides a simpler
       interface  to  the  Tk_MeasureChars  function.  The return
       value is how much space in pixels the given string  needs.

       Tk_DrawChars draws the string at the given location in the
       given drawable.

       Tk_UnderlineChars underlines the given range of characters
       in  the  given  string.   It  doesn't  draw the characters
       (which are assumed to have been  displayed  previously  by
       Tk_DrawChars);  it  just draws the underline.  This proce­
       dure is used to underline a few characters without  having
       to  construct  an  underlined  font.   To produce natively
       underlined text, the appropriate underlined font should be
       constructed and used.
