       RAND_file_name() generates a default path for the random
       seed file. bbuuff points to a buffer of size nnuumm in which to
       store the filename. The seed file is $RANDFILE if that
       environment variable is set, $HOME/.rnd otherwise. If
       $HOME is not set either, or nnuumm is too small for the path
       name, an error occurs.

       RAND_load_file() reads a number of bytes from file
       ffiilleennaammee and adds them to the PRNG. If mmaaxx_bbyytteess is non-
       negative, up to to mmaaxx_bbyytteess are read; starting with
       OpenSSL 0.9.5, if mmaaxx_bbyytteess is -1, the complete file is
       read.

       RAND_write_file() writes a number of random bytes
       (currently 1024) to file ffiilleennaammee which can be used to
       initialize the PRNG by calling RAND_load_file() in a later
       session.

       RAND_load_file() returns the number of bytes read.

       RAND_write_file() returns the number of bytes written, and
       -1 if the bytes written were generated without appropriate
       seed.

       RAND_file_name() returns a pointer to bbuuff on success, and
       NULL on error.
