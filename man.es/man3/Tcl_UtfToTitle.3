DESCRIPTION
       The  first  three  routines convert the case of individual
       Unicode characters:

       If ch represents a lower-case character,  Tcl_UniCharToUp­
       per returns the corresponding upper-case character.  If no
       upper-case character is defined, it returns the  character
       unchanged.

       If  ch  represents  an  upper-case character, Tcl_UniChar­
       ToLower returns the  corresponding  lower-case  character.
       If  no  lower-case  character  is  defined, it returns the
       character unchanged.

       If ch represents a lower-case character,  Tcl_UniCharToTi­
       tle returns the corresponding title-case character.  If no
       title-case character is defined,  it  returns  the  corre­
       sponding upper-case character.  If no upper-case character
       is defined, it returns the  character  unchanged.   Title-
       case is defined for a small number of characters that have
       a different appearance when they are at the beginning of a
       capitalized word.

       The  next three routines convert the case of UTF-8 strings
       in place in memory:

       Tcl_UtfToUpper changes every UTF-8  character  in  str  to
       upper-case.   Because changing the case of a character may
       change its size, the byte offset of each character in  the
       resulting  string  may  differ from its original location.
       Tcl_UtfToUpper writes a null byte at the end of  the  con­
       verted  string.   Tcl_UtfToUpper returns the new length of
       the string in bytes.  This new length is guaranteed to  be
       no longer than the original string length.

       Tcl_UtfToLower  is  the  same  as Tcl_UtfToUpper except it
       turns each character in the  string  into  its  lower-case
       equivalent.

       Tcl_UtfToTitle  is  the  same  as Tcl_UtfToUpper except it
       turns the first character in the string  into  its  title-
       case  equivalent  and  all following characters into their
       lower-case equivalents.


BUGS
       At this time, the case conversions are  only  defined  for
       the ISO8859-1 characters.  Unicode characters above 0x00ff
       are not modified by these routines.
