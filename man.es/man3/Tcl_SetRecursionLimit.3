NAME
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit  -  set  maximum  allowable  nesting
       depth in interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit(interp, depth)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp   *interp   (in)      Interpreter whose  recur­
                                        sion  limit is to be set.
                                        Must  be   greater   than
                                        zero.

       int          depth     (in)      New   limit   for  nested
                                        calls  to  Tcl_Eval   for
                                        interp.

DESCRIPTION
       At  any  given  time Tcl enforces a limit on the number of
       recursive calls  that  may  be  active  for  Tcl_Eval  and
       related  procedures  such  as Tcl_GlobalEval.  Any call to
       Tcl_Eval that exceeds this depth is aborted with an error.
       By default the recursion limit is 1000.

       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit  may  be  used to change the maximum
       allowable nesting depth for  an  interpreter.   The  depth
       argument  specifies a new limit for interp, and Tcl_SetRe­
       cursionLimit returns the old limit.  To read out  the  old
       limit  without  modifying it, invoke Tcl_SetRecursionLimit
       with depth equal to 0.

       The Tcl_SetRecursionLimit only sets the size  of  the  Tcl
       call  stack:   it cannot by itself prevent stack overflows
       on the C stack being used by  the  application.   If  your
       machine  has  a  limit on the size of the C stack, you may
       get stack overflows  before  reaching  the  limit  set  by
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit.  If this happens, see if there is a
       mechanism in your system for increasing the  maximum  size
       of the C stack.
