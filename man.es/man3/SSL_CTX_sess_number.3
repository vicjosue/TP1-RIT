       SSL_CTX_sess_number() returns the current number of
       sessions in the internal session cache.

       SSL_CTX_sess_connect() returns the number of started
       SSL/TLS handshakes in client mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_connect_good() returns the number of
       successfully established SSL/TLS sessions in client mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_connect_renegotiate() returns the number of
       start renegotiations in client mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_accept() returns the number of started
       SSL/TLS handshakes in server mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_accept_good() returns the number of
       successfully established SSL/TLS sessions in server mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_accept_renegotiate() returns the number of
       start renegotiations in server mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_hits() returns the number of successfully
       reused sessions.  In client mode a session set with
       SSL_set_session(3) successfully reused is counted as a
       hit. In server mode a session successfully retrieved from
       internal or external cache is counted as a hit.

       SSL_CTX_sess_cb_hits() returns the number of successfully
       retrieved sessions from the external session cache in
       server mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_misses() returns the number of sessions
       proposed by clients that were not found in the internal
       session cache in server mode.

       SSL_CTX_sess_timeouts() returns the number of sessions
       proposed by clients and either found in the internal or
       external session cache in server mode,
        but that were invalid due to timeout. These sessions are
       not included in the SSL_CTX_sess_hits() count.

       SSL_CTX_sess_cache_full() returns the number of sessions
       that were removed because the maximum session cache size
       was exceeded.
