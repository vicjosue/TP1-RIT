       SSL_CTX_add_session() adds the session cc to the context
       ccttxx. The reference count for session cc is incremented by
       1. If a session with the same session id already exists,
       the old session is removed by calling SSL_SESSION_free(3).

       SSL_CTX_remove_session() removes the session cc from the
       context ccttxx.  SSL_SESSION_free(3) is called once for cc.

       SSL_add_session() and SSL_remove_session() are synonyms
       for their SSL_CTX_*() counterparts.

NNOOTTEESS
       When adding a new session to the internal session cache,
       it is examined whether a session with the same session id
       already exists. In this case it is assumed that both
       sessions are identical. If the same session is stored in a
       different SSL_SESSION object, The old session is removed
       and replaced by the new session. If the session is
       actually identical (the SSL_SESSION object is identical),
       SSL_CTX_add_session() is a no-op, and the return value is
       0.

       The following values are returned by all functions:

       0

            The operation failed. In case of the add operation, it was tried to add
            the same (identical) session twice. In case of the remove operation, the
            session was not found in the cache.


       1    The operation succeeded.
