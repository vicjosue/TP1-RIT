NAME
       lib/md5sum.c - Generate/check MD5 Message Digests.

SYNOPSIS
       #include 'system.h'
       #include 'md5.h'
       #include 'rpmio_internal.h'
       #include 'debug.h'

   Functions
       int domd5 (const char *fn, unsigned char *digest, int
           asAscii, int brokenEndian)
           Calculate MD5 sum for file.
       int mdbinfile (const char *fn, unsigned char *bindigest)
           Return MD5 sum of file as binary data.
       int mdbinfileBroken (const char *fn, unsigned char
           *bindigest)
           Return (broken!) MD5 sum of file as binary data.
       int mdfile (const char *fn, unsigned char *digest)
       int mdfileBroken (const char *fn, unsigned char *digest)
           Return (broken!) MD5 sum of file as ASCII string.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       Generate/check MD5 Message Digests.

        Compile and link with md5.c. If you don't have getopt()
       in your library also include getopt.c. For MSDOS you can
       also link with the wildcard initialization function
       (wildargs.obj for Turbo C and setargv.obj for MSC) so that
       you can use wildcards on the commandline.
