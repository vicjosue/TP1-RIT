GETCONTEXT(2)       Linux Programmer's Manual       GETCONTEXT(2)



NAME
       getcontext, setcontext - get or set the user context

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ucontext.h>

       int getcontext(ucontext_t *ucp);
       int setcontext(const ucontext_t *ucp);

       where:

       ucp    points  to a structure defined in <ucontext.h> con­
              taining  the  signal  mask,  execution  stack,  and
              machine registers.

DESCRIPTION
       getcontext(2) gets the current context of the calling pro­
       cess, storing it in the ucontext struct pointed to by ucp.

       setcontext(2)  sets  the context of the calling process to
       the state stored in the ucontext struct pointed to by ucp.
       The  struct must either have been created by getcontext(2)
       or have been passed as the third parameter of  the  sigac­
       tion(2) signal handler.

       The ucontext struct created by getcontext(2) is defined in
       <ucontext.h> as follows:

              typedef struct ucontext
                {
                    unsigned long int uc_flags;
                    struct ucontext *uc_link;
                    stack_t uc_stack;
                    mcontext_t uc_mcontext;
                    __sigset_t uc_sigmask;
                    struct _fpstate __fpregs_mem;
                  } ucontext_t;

RETURN VALUES
       getcontext(2) returns 0 on  success  and  -1  on  failure.
       setcontext(2)  does  not  return  a  value  on success and
       returns -1 on failure.

STANDARDS
       These functions comform to: XPG4-UNIX.

NOTES
       When a signal handler executes, the current  user  context
       is  saved  and a new context is created by the kernel.  If
       the  calling  process  leaves  the  signal  handler  using
       longjmp(2),  the  original context cannot be restored, and
       the result of future calls  to  getcontext(2)  are  unpre­
       dictable. To avoid this problem, use siglongjmp(2) or set­
       context(2) in signal handlers instead of longjmp(2).
