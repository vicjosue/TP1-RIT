cli(9)                   Kernel Functions                  cli(9)



NAME
       cli, sti - disable/enable interrupts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <asm/system.h>

       extern void cli()
       extern void sti()

DESCRIPTION
       The  cli  function  causes interrupts to be blocked on the
       host, so that following critical  code  may  run  uninter­
       rupted. The sti function enables interrupts again.

       Although  it  is  possible to use cli/sti pairs to protect
       critical code, it is best to use cli with  the  save_flags
       macro. See save_flags (9).

RETURN VALUE
       none

AVAILABILITY
       Linux 1.0+
