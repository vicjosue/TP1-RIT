pcibios_find_class(9)    BIOS32 Functions   pcibios_find_class(9)



NAME
       pcibios_find_class, pcibios_find_device - find a PCI class
       or device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/bios32.h>


       int pcibios_find_class(unsigned int class_code, unsigned
       short index, unsigned char* bus, unsigned char*
       device_fn);

       int pcibios_find_device(unsigned short  vendor,
       unsigned short device_id ",unsigned short "index,
       unsigned char* bus, unsigned char* device_fn);

DESCRIPTION
       The pcibios_find_class function  searches  for  a  certain
       class  of  device on the PCI bus.  In this instance, class
       is  used  to  represent  a  few  different  categories  of
       devices.  Some examples are storage, network, display, and
       memory classes. The classes are defined by the PCI  Speci­
       fication,  and the class_code is matched with the dword in
       the configuration space of the device at offset 0x08.

       The pcibios_find_device function finds a device on the PCI
       bus  that has the matching device and vendor ids. The ven­
       dor ids are assigned to the PCI Sig  to  vendors,  who  in
       turn  assign  device  ids to the devices they develop. The
       vendor and device ids are encoded in  dword  0x00  of  the
       configuration space.

       Both pcibios_find_class and pcibios_find_device include an
       extra index parameter, which is used to  select  the  spe­
       cific  device if there are multiple matches. An index of 0
       matches the firts located board, 1 the second, and so  on.

       The  bus and device_fn parameters are PCI specific cookies
       that are passed to other pcibios functions to  access  the
       configuration space of the located device.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the functions return PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL.  Oth­
       erwise, one of the following error codes is returned:

              PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND
                     There is no device that matches  the  search
                     criteria,

              PCIBIOS_BAD_VENDOR_ID
                     The  vendor  id is invalid. (0xffff is not a
                     valid id.)

              PCIBIOS_FUNC_NOT_SUPPRTED
                     The PCI subsystem is not available
