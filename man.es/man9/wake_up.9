wake_up(9)               Kernel Functions              wake_up(9)



NAME
       wake_up - wake up sleeping processes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/sched.h>

       void wake_up(struct wait_queue**condition)

DESCRIPTION
       The  wake_up  function  is the opposite of the sleep_on(9)
       function in that it awakens processes that  have  gone  to
       sleep using the same condition variable. All the processes
       sleeping on the given condition are awakened. If there are
       no  processes  sleeping  on  the  condition, then none are
       affected.

       Unlike the sleep_on(9) function, wake_up  does  not  block
       and may be called by interrupt handlers. It is in fact the
       principle means of synchronizing with interrupt events.

       If the condition parameter is NULL, or there are  no  pro­
       cesses sleeping on condition, the call to wake_up is a no-
       op.

RETURN VALUE
       None.
