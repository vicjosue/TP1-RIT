SKB_QUEUE_HEAD(9)      Networking Functions     SKB_QUEUE_HEAD(9)



NAME
       skb_queue_head - insert an sk_buff at the head of a list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/skbuff.h>

       void  __skb_queue_head(struct sk_buff_head *list, struct
              sk_buff *newsk);

       void  skb_queue_head(struct sk_buff_head *list, struct
       sk_buff *newsk);


DESCRIPTION
       The skb_queue_head function adds  newsk  to  the  head  of
       list.   Specifically,  it  sets  the  list, next, and prev
       pointers in newsk, and  increments  the  qlen  element  of
       list.   It  also  rearranges the next and prev pointers in
       the existing head of list before returning.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

NOTES
       It is important to note the difference  between  not  only
       __skb_queue_head  and  skb_queue_head,  but all the __skb_
       functions and their skb_ counterparts.   Essentially,  the
       __skb_  functions  are non-atomic, and should only be used
       with interrupts disabled.   As  a  convenience,  the  skb_
       functions  are provided, which perform interrupt disable /
       enable wrapper functionality  in  addition  to  performing
       their specific tasks.
