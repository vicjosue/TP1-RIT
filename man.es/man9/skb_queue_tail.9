NAME
       __skb_queue_tail, skb_queue_tail - insert an sk_buff at
       the tail of a list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/skbuff.h>

       void  __skb_queue_tail(struct sk_buff_head *list, struct
              sk_buff *newsk);

       void  skb_queue_tail(struct sk_buff_head *list, struct
       sk_buff *newsk);

DESCRIPTION
       The  skb_queue_tail  function  adds  newsk  to the tail of
       list.  Specifically, it sets  the  list,  next,  and  prev
       pointers  in  newsk,  and  increments  the qlen element of
       list.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

NOTES
       It is important to note the difference  between  not  only
       __skb_queue_tail  and  skb_queue_tail,  but all the __skb_
       functions and their skb_ counterparts.   Essentially,  the
       __skb_  functions  are non-atomic, and should only be used
       with interrupts disabled.   As  a  convenience,  the  skb_
       functions  are provided, which perform interrupt disable /
       enable wrapper functionality  in  addition  to  performing
       their specific tasks.

AVAILABILITY
