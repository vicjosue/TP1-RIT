NAME
       intro - Introduction to kernel interface

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/version.h>

DESCRIPTION
       This  section  documents the functions available to device
       driver writers and kernel level modules. The functions are
       of interest mainly to device driver writers, although any­
       one considering running code in linux kernel mode may need
       to be familiar with these interfaces.

       Some  of  the  functions  of the DDI exist only in certain
       versions of the kernel. Use the  LINUX_VERSION_CODE  macro
       to  test for specific versions of the kernel. For example,
       to use a feature that is new to 2.1, say:

       #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= 0x020100
           ... use new stuff ...
       #else
           ... do it the old way ...
       #endif

       The following is a list of the man pages, divided  roughly
       into function groups.

   Kernel Functions
       These are general kernel functions.

              MAJOR

              MOD_INC_USE_COUNT

              cli

              init_bh

              init_module

              proc_scsi_register

   BIOS32 functions
       These are specific to PCI (BIOS32) support.

              pcibios_find_class

              pcibios_present

              pcibios_read_config_byte

              pcibios_read_config_word

              pcibios_strerror

              pcibios_write_config_byte

              pcibios_write_config_dword

              pcibios_write_config_word

   VM functions
       These are functions that support manipulating the  virtual
       memory subsystem.

              MAP_NR

              mem_map_reserve

   Network Functions
              skb_dequeue

              skb_insert

              skb_peek

              skb_queue_empty

              skb_queue_head

              skb_queue_head_init

              skb_queue_len

              skb_queue_tail

              skb_unlink

AVAILABILITY
       Each  man  page attempts to list the kernel versions where
       the function is available. If the  form  of  the  function
       changes,  this  section  tells  when  the  described  form
       applies.

SEE ALSO
       This section lists other man pages that may be  of  inter­
       est.  Also,  interesting  source files in the linux kernel
       may be listed here.

AUTHORS
       Each man page has a section like this one that  lists  the
       author(s)  who  contributed  significantly  to  that page.
       Other unnamed individuals may also have  contributed  cor­
       rections, editorial, etc.

       Major  contributors are (in alphabetical order) Cyrus Dur­
       gin        <cider@speakeasy.org>,        Niel        Moore
       <amethyst@maxwell.ml.org>,  Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>,
       Kirk Petersen <kirk@speakeasy.org>, and  Stephen  Williams
       <steve@icarus.com>.

       Editorial,  and  this  intro  page,  were  done by Stephen
       Williams <steve@icarus.com>.

BUGS
       The living linux kernel is a moving target, and the kernel
       functions  are  unique  to  linux. Therefore, although the
       editor and contributers make a good effort to be as  accu­
       rate  as  possible,  errors may exist. The source codes of
       the linux kernel are the ultimate authority on the  behav­
       ior  of  any  function  and should be considered the final
       word.
