NAME
       register_console - take on kernel console duties

SYNOPSIS
       extern void register_console(void(*proc)(const char*))

DESCRIPTION
       This function registers with the kernel a function to dis­
       play all the kernel  messages  printed  by  the  printk(9)
       function.

       This  function is normally called once at boot time by the
       device driver for the console device, whatever that  turns
       out  to  be for the machine. The console procedure is only
       called to print messages that are to be printed, the  fil­
       tering for log level is done already.

       None.

BUGS
       Only  one console can exist at a time, and there is no way
       to know if any other device has registered as a console.
