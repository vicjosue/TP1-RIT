MAJOR(9)                 Kernel Functions                MAJOR(9)



NAME
       MAJOR, MINOR, MKDEV - macros to manipulate device
       major/minor numbers

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/fs.h>

       #define MAJOR(dev)
       #define MINOR(dev)
       #define MKDEV(major, minor)


DESCRIPTION
       The MAJOR and MINOR macros extract from a  device  id  (of
       type  dev_t)  the major and minor numbers respectively. It
       is the  combined  device  number  that  is  found  in  the
       struct~file structure.

       The  MKDEV  macro  assembles a device number from the sup­
       plied major and minor numbers.

RETURN VALUE
       Describe the return values.  Enumerate  all  the  distinct
       values and all the ranges.

AVAILABILITY
       Linux 0.0+

       In  later  kernels (Linux 2.1 and later) there is movement
       towards using 64bit device numbers. Although it is  gener­
       ally a good idea to not presume to know how device numbers
       are constructed, it is during this  period  of  transition
       fundamentally  important that you ONLY use these functions
       to manipulate device numbers.

BUGS
       These  are macros, so parameters may be evaluated multiple
       times.
