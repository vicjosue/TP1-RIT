NAME
       run-parts - run scripts or programs in a directory

SYNOPSIS
       run-parts  [--test] [--verbose] [--report] [--umask=umask]
       [--arg=argument] [--help] [--version] directory

DESCRIPTION
       run-parts runs a number of scripts or programs found in  a
       single  directory  directory.   Filenames  should  consist
       entirely of upper and lower case letters,  digits,  under­
       scores,  and  hyphens.   Subdirectories  of  directory and
       files with other names will be silently ignored.

       Scripts must follow the #!/bin/interpretername  convention
       in  order  to be executed.  They will not automatically be
       executed by /bin/sh.

       The files found will be run in the lexical sort  order  of
       the filenames.

   OPTIONS
       --test print  the names of the scripts which would be run,
              but don't actually run them.

       --verbose
              print the name of each script to stderr before run­
              ning.

       --report
              similiar  to --verbose, but only prints the name of
              scripts which produce output.  The script's name is
              printed to whichever of stdout or stderr the script
              first produces output on.

       --umask=umask
              Sets the umask to umask before running the scripts.
              umask should be specified in octal.  By default the
              umask is set to 022.

       --arg=argument
              Pass argument to the scripts.  Use --arg  once  for
              each argument you want passed.

       --     Specifies that this is the end of the options.  Any
              filename after -- will be not be interpreted as  an
              option even if it starts with a hyphen.

       --help Display usage information and exit.

       --version
              Display version and copyright and exit.
