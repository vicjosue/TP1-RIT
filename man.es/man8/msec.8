NAME
       msec - Mandrake security tools

SYNOPSIS
       msec [0-5]

DESCRIPTION
       msec  is  the  main script of msec package. It enables the
       system administrator to change the security level for that
       system.   msec is provided with six preconfigured security
       levels. These levels range from poor security and ease  of
       use,  to  paranoid  config,  suitable  for  very sensitive
       server applications, managed by experts.

       You must be root to run msec .
       Launch "msec x" to set you security level to x  (x=[0-5]).
       It'll  modify  your  system  according to security level x
       features.
       For a fine description of each security level, consult the
       documentation under /usr/share/doc/msec-0.19/security.txt.

       If you want to make changes  to  the  current  level,  use
       /etc/security/msec/perm.local   to  override  the  permis­
       sions/owners/groups and /etc/security/msec/level.local  to
       override the rules (see mseclib(3) for details).

FILES
       /usr/sbin/msec
       The msec executable (sh script)

       /var/lib/msec/security.conf
       Contains  the configuration of the current active security
       level. These settings  can  be  overridden  in  /etc/secu­
       rity/msec/security.conf.
