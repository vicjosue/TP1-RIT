LASTLOG(8)                                             LASTLOG(8)



NAME
       lastlog - examine lastlog file

SYNOPSIS
       lastlog [-u login-name] [-t days]

DESCRIPTION
       lastlog  formats and prints the contents of the last login
       log, /var/log/lastlog.  The  login-name,  port,  and  last
       login time will be printed.  The default (no flags) causes
       lastlog entries to be printed,  sorted  by  the  numerical
       UID.   Entering  -u login-name flag will cause the lastlog
       record for login-name only to  be  printed.   Entering  -t
       days  will cause only the lastlogins more recent than days
       to be printed.  The -t flag overrides the use of -u.

       If the user has  never  logged  in  the  message  "**Never
       logged  in**"  will  be  displayed instead of the port and
       time.

FILES
       /var/log/lastlog - lastlog logging file

CAVEATS
       Large gaps in uid numbers will cause the  lastlog  program
       to  run  longer  with  no  output  to  the screen (i.e. if
       mmdf=800 and last uid=170, program will appear to hang  as
       it processes uid 171-799).
