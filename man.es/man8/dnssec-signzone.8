DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-signzone  signs  a  zone.  It generates NXT and SIG
       records and produces a signed  version  of  the  zone.  If
       there is a signedkey file from the zone's parent, the par­
       ent's signatures will be incorporated into  the  generated
       signed  zone file. The security status of delegations from
       the the signed zone (that is, whether the child zones  are
       secure or not) is determined by the presence or absence of
       a signedkey file for each child zone.

OPTIONS
       -a     Verify all generated signatures.

       -c class
              Specifies the DNS class of the zone.

       -d directory
              Look for signedkey files in directory as the direc­
              tory

       -s start-time
              Specify  the  date  and time when the generated SIG
              records become valid. This can be either  an  abso­
              lute  or  relative  time. An absolute start time is
              indicated by a number in  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS  notation;
              20000530144500  denotes  14:45:00  UTC on May 30th,
              2000. A relative start time  is  indicated  by  +N,
              which  is  N  seconds from the current time.  If no
              start-time is specified, the current time is  used.

       -e end-time
              Specify  the  date  and time when the generated SIG
              records expire. As  with  start-time,  an  absolute
              time  is  indicated  in  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A
              time relative to the start time is  indicated  with
              +N,  which is N seconds from the start time. A time
              realtive to the  current  time  is  indicated  with
              now+N.  If  no  end-time is specified, 30 days from
              the start time is used as a default.

       -f output-file
              The name of the output file containing  the  signed
              zone. The default is to append .signed to the input
              file.

       -h     Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
              to dnssec-signzone.

       -i interval
              When  a  previously signed zone is passed as input,
              records may be resigned. The interval option speci­
              fies  the  cycle  interval  as  an  offset from the
              current time (in seconds). If a SIG record  expires
              after  the  cycle  interval, it is retained. Other­
              wise, it is considered to be expiring soon, and  it
              will be replaced.

              The  default  cycle  interval is one quarter of the
              difference between  the  signature  end  and  start
              times.  So  if  neither  end-time or start-time are
              specified,  dnssec-signzone  generates   signatures
              that  are  valid for 30 days, with a cycle interval
              of 7.5 days. Therefore, if any existing SIG records
              are due to expire in less than 7.5 days, they would
              be replaced.

       -n ncpus
              Specifies the number of threads to use. By default,
              one thread is started for each detected CPU.

       -o origin
              The  zone origin. If not specified, the name of the
              zone file is assumed to be the origin.

       -p     Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone.  This
              is  faster, but less secure, than using real random
              data. This option may be useful when signing  large
              zones or when the entropy source is limited.

       -r randomdev
              Specifies  the source of randomness. If the operat­
              ing system does not provide a /dev/random or equiv­
              alent  device,  the default source of randomness is
              keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name  of  a
              character  device or file containing random data to
              be used instead of the default. The  special  value
              keyboard  indicates  that  keyboard input should be
              used.

       -t     Print statistics at completion.

       -v level
              Sets the debugging level.

       zonefile
              The file containing the zone to  be  signed.   Sets
              the debugging level.

       key    The  keys  used  to  sign  the zone. If no keys are
              specified, the default all zone keys that have pri­
              vate key files in the current directory.

EXAMPLE
       The  following command signs the example.com zone with the
       DSA key generated  in  the  dnssec-keygen  man  page.  The
       zone's  keys  must  be in the zone. If there are signedkey
       files associated with this zone or any child  zones,  they
       must  be  in the current directory.  example.com, the fol­
       lowing command would be issued:

       dnssec-signzone  -o  example.com   db.example.com   Kexam­
       ple.com.+003+26160

       The command would print a string of the form:

       In this example, dnssec-signzone creates the file db.exam­
       ple.com.signed. This file should be referenced in  a  zone
       statement in a named.conf file.
