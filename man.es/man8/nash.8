NAME
       nash - script interpretor to interpret linuxrc images

SYNOPSIS
       nash [--force] script


DESCRIPTION
       nash is a very simple script interpretor designed to be as
       small as possible. It is primarily designed to run  simple
       linuxrc  scripts on an initrd image. Arguments to commands
       may be enclosed in either single or double quotes to allow
       spaces  to be included in the arguments. Spaces outside of
       quotations always delineate arguments,  and  so  backslash
       escaping is supported.

       Additionally,  if  nash  is  invoked  as modprobe, it will
       immediately exit with a return code of zero.  This  is  to
       allow  initrd's  to  prevent  some extraneous kernel error
       messages during startup originating from kmod.

       There are two types of commands, built  in  and  external.
       External   commands   are  run  from  the  filesystem  via
       execve(). If commands names are given without a path, nash
       will  search  it's  builtin PATH, which is /usr/bin, /bin,
       /sbin, /usr/sbin.

       Currently, nash supports the following built in  commands.


       echo [item]* [> filename]
              Echos  the  text  strings  given  to a file, with a
              space in between  each  item.  The  output  may  be
              optionally redirected to a file.

              exec  <command>  The command given is execed, over­
              laying the nash process.


       losetup /dev/loopdev file
              Binds file to the loopback device /dev/loopdev. See
              losetup(8) for information on loopback devices.


       mkdir [-p] path
              Creates  the  directory  path.  If -p is specified,
              this command will not  complain  if  the  directory
              exists. Note this is a subset of the standard mkdir
              -p behavior.


       mkrootdev path
              Makes path a  block  inode  for  the  device  whose
              device number is /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev.


       mount [--ro] -t type device mntpoint [flags]
              Mounts  a  filesystem. It does not support NFS, and
              it must be used in exactly the form given above. If
              --ro is given, the filesystem is mounted read only.
              flags may be omitted.


       pivot_root newrootpath oldrootpath
              Makes the filesystem mounted at newrootpath the new
              root   filesystem,  and  mounts  the  current  root
              filesystem as oldrootpath.


       raidautorun mddevice
              Runs raid autodetection on  all  raid-typed  parti­
              tions.  mddevice  must  be  a raid device (any will
              do).


       umount path
              Unmounts the filesystem mounted at path.


       handledevfs
              Useful  after  a  pivot_root,  because  the   devfs
              filesystem,  if already mounted by the kernel (with
              the use of kernel parameter devfs=mount), is at the
              wrong  location  (/initrd/dev  instead of /dev) and
              needs to be remounted at the correct location.


OPTIONS
       --force
              Allows force really execute the script, even though
              nash  doesn't  appear  to be running from an initrd
              image.


BUGS
       Probably many. nash is not a shell, and  it  shouldn't  be
       though  of  as  one.  It  isn't  entirely different from a
       shell, but that's mostly by accident.
