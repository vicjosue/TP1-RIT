CONVERTQUOTA(8)                                   CONVERTQUOTA(8)



NAME
       convertquota  -  convert quota from old file format to new
       one

SYNOPSIS
       convertquota [ -ug ] filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       convertquota  converts  old  quota  files  quota.user  and
       quota.group  to  files aquota.user and aquota.group in new
       format currently used by 2.4.0-ac? and newer or by Red Hat
       Linux 2.4 kernels on filesystem.

       New  file  format  allows  using  quotas for 32-bit uids /
       gids, setting quotas for root, accounting  used  space  in
       bytes  (and  so allowing use of quotas in ReiserFS) and it
       is also architecture independent. This  format  introduces
       Radix  Tree  (a  simple  form  of tree structure) to quota
       file.

OPTIONS
       -u     convert user quota file. This is the default.

       -g     convert group quota file.

       -V     print version information.

FILES
       aquota.user         new user quota file

       aquota.group        new group quota file
