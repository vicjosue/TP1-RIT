NAME
       edquota - edit user quotas

SYNOPSIS
       edquota [ -p protoname ] [ -ug ] [ -r ] [ -F format-name ]
       username...

       edquota [ -ug ] [ -F format-name ] -t

DESCRIPTION
       edquota is a quota editor.  One or more  users  or  groups
       may  be  specified  on the command line.  For each user or
       group a temporary file is created with an ASCII  represen­
       tation  of  the current disk quotas for that user or group
       and an editor is then invoked on the file.  The quotas may
       then  be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota
       to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.

       Users are permitted to exceed  their  soft  limits  for  a
       grace  period  that may be specified per filesystem.  Once
       the grace period has expired, the soft limit  is  enforced
       as a hard limit.

       The  current usage information in the file is for informa­
       tional purposes; only the hard  and  soft  limits  can  be
       changed.

       Upon  leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary file
       and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes
       made.

       The  editor  invoked  is vi(1) unless either the EDITOR or
       the VISUAL environment variable specifies otherwise.

       Only the super-user may edit quotas.

OPTIONS
       -r     Edit also non-local quota use rpc.rquotad on remote
              server  to set quota.  The -n option is equivalent,
              and is maintained for backward compatibility.

       -u     Edit the user quota. This is the default.

       -g     Edit the group quota.

       -p protoname
              Duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user spec­
              ified  for each user specified.  This is the normal
              mechanism used to initialize quotas for  groups  of
              users.

       -F format-name
              Edit  quota for specified format (ie. don't perform
              format autodetection).  Possible format names  are:
              vfsold  (version 1 quota), vfsv0 (version 2 quota),
              rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -t     Edit  the soft time limits for each filesystem.  In
              old quota format if the time limits are  zero,  the
              default time limits in <linux/quota.h> are used. In
              new quota format  time  limits  must  be  specified
              (there  is  no  default  value set in kernel). Time
              units of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,  and
              months  are  understood. Time limits are printed in
              the greatest possible time unit such that the value
              is greater than or equal to one.

FILES
       aquota.user or aquota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root

       quota.user or quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root
