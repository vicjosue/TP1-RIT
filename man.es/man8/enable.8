NAME
       disable, enable - stop/start printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       disable [ -E ] [ -c ] [ -h server ] [ -r reason ] destina­
       tion(s)
       enable [ -E ] destination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       enable starts the named printers or classes.

       disable stops the named printers or classes.  The  follow­
       ing options may be used:

       -c
            Cancels all jobs on the named destination.

       -r [ reason ]
            Sets  the  message associated with the stopped state.
            If no reason is specified then the message is set  to
            "Reason Unknown".

       The  -E  option  forces  encryption when connecting to the
       server.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CUPS versions of disable and enable may ask  the  user
       for  an  access  password depending on the printing system
       configuration.  This differs from the  System  V  versions
       which require the root user to execute these commands.
