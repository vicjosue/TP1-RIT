NAME
       pam_console_apply - set or revoke permissions for users at
       the system console

SYNOPSIS
       pam_console_apply [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_console_apply sets or resets permissions on devices in
       the same manner as pam_console.
       If  /var/run/console.lock  exists,  pam_console_apply will
       grant permissions to the user listed therein.  If the lock
       file does not exist, permissions are reset to those listed
       in /etc/security/console.perms, which should be configured
       to set permissions on devices so that root owns them.

ARGUMENTS
       -r     Signals  pam_console_apply  to  reset  permissions.
              The default is to set permissions so that the  user
              listed  in  /var/run/console.lock has access to the
              devices, and to reset permissions if no  such  file
              exists.

FILES
       /var/run/console.lock
       /etc/security/console.perms
