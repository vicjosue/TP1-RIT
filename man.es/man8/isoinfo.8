       isoinfo [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -R ] [ -J ] [ -j charset ] [ -f  ]

       isovfy isoimage

DESCRIPTION
       devdump is a crude utility to  interactively  display  the
       contents  of  device  or  filesystem  images.  The initial
       screen is a display of the first 256 bytes  of  the  first
       2048  byte sector.  The commands are the same as with iso­
       dump.

       isodump is a crude utility to  interactively  display  the
       contents  of  iso9660  images in order to verify directory
       integrity.  The initial screen is a display of  the  first
       part  of  the root directory, and the prompt shows you the
       extent number and offset in the extent.

              You can use the 'a' and 'b' commands to move  back­
              wards  and  forwards within the image. The 'g' com­
              mand allows you to goto an  arbitrary  extent,  and
              the  'f'  command  specifies  a search string to be
              used. The '+' command searches forward for the next
              instance  of the search string, and the 'q' command
              exits devdump or isodump.

       isoinfo is a utility to perform directory like listings of
       iso9660 images.

       isovfy  is a utility to verify the integrity of an iso9660
       image. Most of the tests in isovfy were added  after  bugs
       were  discovered  in  early versions of mkisofs.  It isn't
       all that clear how useful this is anymore, but it  doesn't
       hurt to have this around.


OPTIONS
       Only  the  isoinfo  program  has any command line options.
       These are:

       -h     print a summary of all options.

       -d     Print information from the primary volume  descrip­
              tor  (PVD)  of  the  iso9660  image.  This includes
              information about Rock Ridge and Joliet  extensions
              if present.

       -f     generate output as if a 'find . -print' command had
              been run on the iso9660 image. You should  not  use
              the -l image with the -f option.

       -i iso_image
              Specifies  the  path  of  the iso9660 image that we
              wish to examine.

       -l     generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command  had  been
              run  on  the iso9660 image.  You should not use the
              -f image with the -l option.

       -N sector
              Quick hack to  help  examine  single  session  disc
              files  that  are  to  be written to a multi-session
              disc. The sector number  specified  is  the  sector
              number at which the iso9660 image should be written
              when send to the cd-writer. Not used for the  first
              session on the disc.

       -p     Print path table information.

       -R     Extract  information from Rock Ridge extensions (if
              present) for permissions,  file  names  and  owner­
              ships.

       -J     Extract information from Joliet extensions (if pre­
              sent) for file names.

       -j charset
              Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the  sup­
              plied charset. See mkisofs(8) for details.

       -T sector
              Quick  hack  to  help  examine multi-session images
              that have already been burned  to  a  multi-session
              disc.  The  sector  number  specified is the sector
              number for the start of the session we wish to dis­
              play.

       -x pathname
              Extract specified file to stdout.

AUTHOR
       Eric       Youngdale       <ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu>       or
       <eric@andante.jic.com> is to blame for these shoddy hacks.
       Patches  to  improve  general  usability  would  be gladly
       accepted.

BUGS
       The user interface really sucks.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
       These utilities are really quick  hacks,  which  are  very
       useful  for debugging problems in mkisofs or in an iso9660
       filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice  to  have  a
       daemon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.

       The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the
       most use to the general user.

AVAILABILITY
       These utilities come with the  mkisofs  package,  and  the
       primary      ftp     site     is     tsx-11.mit.edu     in
       /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom/mkisofs and many other mirror sites.
       Despite the name, the software is not beta.
