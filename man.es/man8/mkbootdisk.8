MKBOOTDISK(8)                                       MKBOOTDISK(8)



NAME
       mkbootdisk  -  creates  a  stand-alone boot floppy for the
       running system

SYNOPSIS
       mkbootdisk [--version] [--noprompt] [--verbose]
                  [--mkinitrdargs <args>] [--device <devicefile>]
                  [--compact] <kernel>


DESCRIPTION
       mkbootdisk  creates a boot floppy appropriate for the run­
       ning system. The boot disk is entirely self-contained, and
       includes  an  initial ramdisk image which loads any neces­
       sary SCSI modules for the system. The  created  boot  disk
       looks  for  the root filesystem on the device suggested by
       /etc/fstab.  The only required argument is the kernel ver­
       sion to put onto the boot floppy.


OPTIONS
       --device <devicefile>
              The  boot  image  is  created on <devicefile>fR. If
              --device is not specified, /dev/fd0 is used.


       --mkinitrdargs <args>
              Passes <args>fR to mkinitrd (which is used to  cre­
              ate the initial ramdisk image for the boot floppy).
              Any mkinitrd arguments may be specified.


       --noprompt
              Normally, mkbootdisk instructs the user to insert a
              floppy  and  waits for confirmation before continu­
              ing. If --noprompt is specified, no prompt is  dis­
              played.


       --verbose
              Instructs  mkbootdisk to talk about what it's doing
              as it's doing it. Normally, there is no output from
              mkbootdisk.


       --version
              Displays the version of mkbootdisk and exits.


       --compact
              Use the "compact" LILO option.
