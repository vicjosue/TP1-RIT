NAME
       foomatic-compiledb - complie the foomatic driver database

SYNOPSIS
       foomatic-compiledb [-f ] [-j n ] [ driver ...  ]


DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-compiledb   generally  should  not  be  necessary
       except for people  who  modify  option  and  driver  data.
       Foomatic-datafile  and  especially foomatic-configure will
       automagically compute just what they need at runtime,  and
       cache the results.


   Options
       -f        recompile everything regardless of cache states


       -j n      n  =  number  of  work  processes  to run (150MB
                 each!)


       driver ...
                 only compile the database for these driver(s)



EXIT STATUS
       foomatic-compiledb returns 0 unless  something  unexpected
       happens.
