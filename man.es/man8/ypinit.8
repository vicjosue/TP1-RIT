NAME
       ypinit - NIS database install and build program

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/yp/ypinit [ -m ] [ -s master_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       ypinit  builds  the domain subdirectory of /var/yp for the
       current default domain. After building the  domain  subdi­
       rectory,  ypinit  builds  a complete set of administrative
       maps for your system and places them  in  this  directory.
       The  first  map created by ypinit -m is the ypservers map.
       You should run it as root on the hosts,  which  should  be
       the  master  ypserver.   You  should  have only one master
       server per NIS domain.

       All databases are built from scratch, either from informa­
       tion  available  to  the  program  at runtime, or from the
       ASCII data base files in /etc.   These  files  are  listed
       below under FILES.

       An  NIS database on a slave server is set up by copying an
       existing database from a running server.  The  master_name
       argument  should  be the hostname of an NIS server (either
       the master server for all the maps, or a server  on  which
       the data base is up-to-date and stable).

OPTIONS
       -m     If the local host is the NIS master.

       -s     Set  up  a slave server with the database from mas­
              ter_name

FILES
       /etc/passwd
       /etc/group
       /etc/hosts
       /etc/networks
       /etc/services
       /etc/protocols
       /etc/netgroup
       /etc/rpc

BUGS
       There isn't a good error handling at the moment.
