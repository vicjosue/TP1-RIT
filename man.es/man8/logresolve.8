NAME
       logresolve  -  resolve hostnames for IP-adresses in Apache
       logfiles

SYNOPSIS
       logresolve  [  -s  filename  ]  [  -c  ]  <  access_log  >
       access_log.new


DESCRIPTION
       logresolve  is  a  post-processing  program to resolve IP-
       adresses in Apache's access logfiles.  To minimize  impact
       on  your  nameserver, logresolve has its very own internal
       hash-table cache. This means that each IP number will only
       be looked up the first time it is found in the log file.

OPTIONS
       -s filename Specifies a filename to record statistics.

       -c          This  causes  logresolve  to  apply  some  DNS
                   checks: after finding the hostname from the IP
                   address,  it looks up the IP addresses for the
                   hostname and checks that one of these  matches
                   the original address.
