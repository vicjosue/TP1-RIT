NAME
       proftpd  - Professional configurable, secure file transfer
       protocol server

SYNOPSIS
       proftpd [ -hlntv ] [ -d debuglevel ] [ -c config-file ]  [
       -p 0|1 ]

DESCRIPTION
       proftpd  is  the Professional File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
       server daemon.  The server may be invoked by the  Internet
       "super-server"  inetd(8) each time a connection to the FTP
       service is made, or alternatively  it  can  be  run  as  a
       stand-alone daemon.

       When  proftpd  is run in standalone mode and it receives a
       SIGHUP then it will reread its config file.  When  run  in
       standalone  mode  without  the -n option, the main proftpd
       daemon writes its process ID  to  /var/run/proftpd.pid  to
       make it easy to know which process to SIGHUP.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display  a  short usage description, including
                   all available options.

       -n,--nodaemon
                   Runs the proftpd process  in  standalone  mode
                   (must  be configured as such in the configura­
                   tion file), but does not background  the  pro­
                   cess  or  disassociate it from the controlling
                   tty.  Additionally, all output (log  or  debug
                   messages)  are sent to stdout, rather than the
                   syslog mechanism.  Most often used with the -d
                   option for debugging.

       -v,--version
                   Displays the version number of ProFTPD to std­
                   out.

       -d,--debug debuglevel
                   Sets proftpd's internal debug level  (normally
                   0).  The debuglevel should be an integer value
                   from 0 to 5,  with  higher  numbers  producing
                   more  debug  output.  Normally, debug messages
                   are sent to syslog using the  DEBUG  facility,
                   however  if  the  -n  option is used, all such
                   output is sent to stdout.

       -c,--config config-file
                   Specifies  an  alternate  config-file  to   be
                   parsed  at  startup,  rather  than the default
                   (typically found in /etc/proftpd.conf).

       -t,--configtest
                   Read the configuration file, report any syntax
                   errors, and exit.

       -p,--persistent 0|1
                   Disables  (0)  or enables (1) the default per­
                   sistent password support, which is  determined
                   at  configure  time  for  each platform.  This
                   option only affects the  default  support,  it
                   can  still  be overridden at run-time with the
                   PersistentPasswd directive.

       -l,--list   Lists all modules compiled into proftpd.
