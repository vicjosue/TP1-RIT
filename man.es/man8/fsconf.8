       ,SH OPTIONS


       --check
              perform a  permission  check  on  various  critical
              files.


       --setuquota user
              sets  the  per user disk quota. It updates the file
              /etc/quota.conf and then installs  the  changes  in
              selected  device.  It  expects  the  following sub-
              options:  --device,  --softk,   --hardk,   --softf,
              --hardf.

              --device   expects   a   device  name  or  a  lable
              (LABEL=xx) as found in /etc/fstab.

              The other options expects a numeric argument or the
              value default.


       --setgquota group
              works like the --setuquota.


       --updatequota
              installs the quota settings in the various devices.
              It is generally used after some user accounts  have
              been created without Linuxconf. The commands solves
              the quota inheritance for every  users  and  groups
              and update the in-kernel quota settings.
