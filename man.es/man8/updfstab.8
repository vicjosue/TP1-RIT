NAME
       updfstab - update /etc/fstab to reflect removable devices

SYNOPSIS
       updfstab [-nt] [--usage]

DESCRIPTION
       updfstab  is  designed  to keep /etc/fstab consistent with
       the devices plugged into your system. It looks for devices
       such as cdroms, zip and jaz drives, ls120 drives, and dig­
       ital cameras on the SCSI and IDE buses. USB  devices  look
       like SCSI devices to user space, so those are supported as
       well, but are only added if they are currently attached to
       the  system  (having a scsi device assigned to them is not
       sufficient).

       Devices which updfstab adds to /etc/fstab are marked  with
       the  kudzu  mount  option  to  distinguish them from other
       devices.  updfstab will not remove devices from /etc/fstab
       unless  they  are  marked  with the kudzu mount option. It
       also  ignores  devices  that   are   already   listed   in
       /etc/fstab, or which have multiple partitions on the media
       currently inserted.


OPTIONS
       -n,--normalize

              Normally, kudzu tries to touch /etc/fstab as little
              as  possible.  When  this  option is given, it will
              instead move all of  the  devices  with  the  kudzu
              mount  option to the end of the file, and will list
              the devices in the same order  the  internal  probe
              returns.


       -t,--test

              When  this  option  is  specified, updstab does not
              update the /etc/fstab file.  Instead,  it  displays
              the  fstab entries it would use to standard out. If
              no changes need to be made, it outputs  the  string
              (nothing  to  do)  rather  then  a  full filesystem
              table.


FILES
       /etc/fstab

BUGS
       The table of devices to probe for is built into  the  exe­
       cutable; a configuration file should be used instead.
