NAME
       kudzu - detects and configures new and/or changed hardware
       on a system


SYNOPSIS
       kudzu

DESCRIPTION
       kudzu detects and configures new and/or  changed  hardware
       on  a  system.   When  started,  kudzu detects the current
       hardware, and checks  it  against  a  database  stored  in
       /etc/sysconfig/hwconf,  if  one exists. It then determines
       if any hardware has been added or removed from the system.
       If so, it gives the users the opportunity to configure any
       added hardware, and unconfigure any removed  hardware.  It
       then updates the database in /etc/sysconfig/hwconf.

       If  no  previous database exists, kudzu attempts to deter­
       mine what devices have already been configured, by looking
       at /etc/modules.conf, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/, and
       /etc/X11/XF86Config.


OPTIONS
       --usage
              Show short usage message.

       --help, -?
              Print help information.

       -q, --quiet
              Run 'quietly'; do only configuration  that  doesn't
              require user input.

       -s, --safe
              Do  only 'safe' probes that won't disturb hardware.
              Currently, this disables the serial probe  and  the
              DDC monitor probe.

       -t, --timeout [seconds]
              This sets the timeout for the initial dialog. If no
              key is pressed before the  timeout  elapses,  kudzu
              exits, and /etc/sysconfig/hwconf is not updated.

FILES
       /etc/sysconfig/hwconf
              Listing of current installed hardware.

       /etc/sysconfig/kudzu
              Configuration for the boot-time hardware probe. Set
              'SAFE' to something other than 'no' to  force  only
              safe probes.

       /etc/modules.conf
              Module configuration file.

       /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
              Network interface configuration files.

       /usr/share/ldetect-lst/pcitable
              PCI id to driver mappings.

BUGS
       The   serial  probe  will  disturb  any  currently  in-use
       devices, and returns odd results if used on machines  act­
       ing  as serial consoles. On some older graphics cards, the
       DDC probe can do strange things.
