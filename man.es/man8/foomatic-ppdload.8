FOOMATIC-PPDLOAD(8)                           FOOMATIC-PPDLOAD(8)



NAME
       foomatic-ppdload - <put a short description here>

SYNOPSIS
       foomatic-ppdload [filename.ppd printer-id]...


DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-ppdload  takes a ppd filename and a printer ID as
       arguments.  It parses a PPD file and  writes  option  data
       into the foomatic database for use with the foomatic "ppd"
       driver and that printer.

       Right now, it will handle Boolean and PickOne options that
       go  in  the  Prolog,  DocumentSetup,  or  PageSetup spots.
       Also, PPD interoption constraints (not to be confused with
       foomatic option to printer and driver mapping constraints)
       are not supported by foomatic.  And of course, the  inter­
       esting  color  and  font  information  from the PPD has no
       place in the  current  foomatic  schema.   All  this  will
       change over time.




EXIT STATUS
       foomatic-ppdload returns ...

BUGS
       There  are  several  limitations,  but it's an interesting
       experiment.
