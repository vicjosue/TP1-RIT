NAME
       accept/reject - accept/reject jobs sent to a destination

SYNOPSIS
       accept destination(s)
       reject [ -E ] [ -h server ] [ -r reason ] destination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       accept  instructs the printing system to accept print jobs
       to the specified destinations.

       reject instructs the printing system to reject print  jobs
       to the specified destinations. The -r option sets the rea­
       son for rejecting print jobs. If not specified the  reason
       defaults to "Reason Unknown".

       The  -E  option  forces  encryption when connecting to the
       server.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CUPS versions of accept and reject may  ask  the  user
       for  an  access  password depending on the printing system
       configuration.  This differs from the  System  V  versions
       which require the root user to execute these commands.
