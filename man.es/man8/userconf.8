       ,SH OPTIONS


       --adduser userid group username shell
              add a new user account with the  specified  parame­
              ters.  Do  not  forget  to quote the username if it
              contains spaces. The interest of using this command
              over  command  such  as useradd (8) is the accounts
              and policies settings. You end  up  with  the  same
              behavior   when   creating  accounts  interactivly.
              Namely, you get

              The post-create script is executed.
              The home is created according to the  specification
              recorded with the group.

              Note  that  on most distribution, useradd is called
              internally.


       --addgroup group
              add a new group.



       --deluser userid [ --archive | --deldata | --keepdata ]
              It deletes a user account. The extra option let you
              control  how  the  user data (the home and the mail
              inbox) are processed.

              Archiving means all the data will be "tared" in the
              old-accounts  sub-directory  (located  in  the same
              directory as the user home directory). The data  is
              archived  in  a file which is name after the userid
              and the date.  This way, a user account may be cre­
              ated  and  delete several time and all archives are
              preserved. You may want to  clean  up  the  archive
              once in a while, potentially twice a year.

              If  the  archiving is successful, then all the data
              and home directory will be deleted.

              The --deldata option deletes both the  home  direc­
              tory and the mail inbox. Nothing is kept.

              The --keepdata option keeps everything in place.


       --delgroup group
              delete a group.


       --help present the command line options sumary.
