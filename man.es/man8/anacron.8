ANACRON(8)            Anacron Users' Manual            ANACRON(8)



NAME
       anacron - runs commands periodically

SYNOPSIS
       anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t anacrontab] [job] ...
       anacron -u [-t anacrontab] [job] ...
       anacron [-V|-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Anacron can be used to execute commands periodically, with
       a  frequency  specified  in days.  Unlike cron(8), it does
       not assume  that  the  machine  is  running  continuously.
       Hence,  it  can be used on machines that aren't running 24
       hours a day, to control daily, weekly,  and  monthly  jobs
       that are usually controlled by cron.

       When executed, Anacron reads a list of jobs from a config­
       uration    file,     normally     /etc/anacrontab     (see
       anacrontab(5)).   This file contains the list of jobs that
       Anacron controls.  Each job entry specifies  a  period  in
       days,  a  delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a
       shell command.

       For each job, Anacron checks whether  this  job  has  been
       executed  in the last n days, where n is the period speci­
       fied for that job.  If not, Anacron runs the  job's  shell
       command, after waiting for the number of minutes specified
       as the delay parameter.

       After the command exits, Anacron records  the  date  in  a
       special  timestamp  file for that job, so it can know when
       to execute it again.  Only the date is used for  the  time
       calculations.  The hour is not used.

       When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.

       Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified
       in the anacrontab matches  any  of  the  job  command-line
       arguments.   The  job arguments can be shell wildcard pat­
       terns (be sure to protect them from your shell  with  ade­
       quate  quoting).   Specifying no job arguments, is equiva­
       lent to specifying "*"  (That is, all jobs will be consid­
       ered).

       Unless  the  -d option is given (see below), Anacron forks
       to the background when it starts, and the  parent  process
       exits immediately.

       Unless the -s or -n options are given, Anacron starts jobs
       immediately when their delay is over.   The  execution  of
       different jobs is completely independent.

       If  a  job  generates any output on its standard output or
       standard error, the output is mailed to the  user  running
       Anacron (usually root).

       Informative  messages about what Anacron is doing are sent
       to syslogd(8) under facility cron, priority notice.  Error
       messages are sent at priority error.

       "Active"  jobs  (i.e. jobs that Anacron already decided to
       run and now wait for their delay to pass,  and  jobs  that
       are currently being executed by Anacron), are "locked", so
       that other copies of Anacron won't run them  at  the  same
       time.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force  execution  of  the jobs, ignoring the times­
              tamps.

       -u     Only update the timestamps of the jobs, to the cur­
              rent date, but don't run anything.

       -s     Serialize  execution  of  jobs.   Anacron  will not
              start a new job before the previous one finished.

       -n     Run jobs now.  Ignore the delay  specifications  in
              the /etc/anacrontab file.  This options implies -s.

       -d     Don't  fork  to  the  background.   In  this  mode,
              Anacron will output informational messages to stan­
              dard error, as well as to syslog.   The  output  of
              jobs is mailed as usual.

       -q     Suppress messages to standard error.  Only applica­
              ble with -d.

       -t anacrontab
              Use specified anacrontab, rather than the default

       -V     Print version information, and exit.

       -h     Print short usage message, and exit.

SIGNALS
       After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits  for  run­
       ning  jobs, if any, to finish and then exits.  This can be
       used to stop Anacron cleanly.

NOTES
       Make sure that  the  time-zone  is  set  correctly  before
       Anacron  is  started.   (The  time-zone affects the date).
       This is usually accomplished by setting the TZ environment
       variable,  or  by installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime
       file.  See tzset(3) for more information.

FILES
       /etc/anacrontab
              Contains specifications of jobs.  See anacrontab(5)
              for a complete description.

       /var/spool/anacron
              This  directory  is  used  by  Anacron  for storing
              timestamp files.

BUGS
       Anacron never  removes  timestamp  files.   Remove  unused
       files manually.

       Anacron  uses  up  to two file descriptors for each active
       job.  It may run out of descriptors if there are more than
       about 125 active jobs (on normal kernels).
