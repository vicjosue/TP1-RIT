NAME
       scrollkeeper-update  -  identify new, modified, or removed
       OMF files and update the scrollkeeper databases

SYNOPSIS
       scrollkeeper-update [ -v ] [ -p database-directory ] [  -o
       omf-directories ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  synchronizes  the scrollkeeper database with the OMF
       directory.  It searches the scrollkeeper OMF directory  to
       identify if any files were added, removed, or modified and
       updates  its  internal  database  files  to  reflect   any
       changes.

       This  utility  is  generally  executed as the last step of
       installation, after the OMF file is copied into place.  It
       is  also  typically the last step of uninstallation, after
       the OMF file is removed.  Using this, an administrator can
       easily  manually  install and uninstall documents into the
       database.  It can also be run to guarantee the database is
       fully up-to-date.

OPTIONS
       -v     Be  verbose:  Say  which  scrollkeeper-install  and
              scrollkeeper-uninstall commands are  being  run  to
              bring the database up to date.

       -p database-directory
              Use  database-directory  as  the  directory for the
              scrollkeeper database rather  than  the  usual  one
              obtained  by running omf-config --pkglocalstatedir.

       -o omf-directories
              Examine the directories  named  in  omf-directories
              rather  than  the one usual one obtained by running
              scrollkeeper-config --omfdir.  The  omf-directories
              can be a colon-separated list of directories.

ENVIRONMENT
       OMF_DIR
              If  no  -o option is specified, this variable over­
              rides the scrollkeeper-config-provided  OMF  direc­
              tory.   It  too  can  be  a colon-separated list of
              directories.
