NAME
       rpc.yppasswdd - NIS password update daemon

SYNOPSIS
       rpc.yppasswdd  [-D  directory] [-e chsh|chfn] [--port num­
       ber]
       rpc.yppasswdd  [-s  shadow]  [-p  passwd]  [-e  chsh|chfn]
       [--port number]
       rpc.yppasswdd -x program|-E program [-e chsh|chfn] [--port
       number]


DESCRIPTION
       rpc.yppasswdd is the RPC server  that  lets  users  change
       their  passwords  in  the  presence of NIS (a.k.a. YP). It
       must be run on the NIS master server for that NIS  domain.

       When  a  yppasswd(1)  client contacts the server, it sends
       the old user password along with the new one.  rpc.yppass­
       wdd will search the system's passwd file for the specified
       user name, verify that the given (old)  password  matches,
       and  update  the  entry.  If  the  user specified does not
       exist, or if the password, UID or GID  doesn't  match  the
       information  in  the  password file, the update request is
       rejected, and an error returned to the client.

       If this version of the server is compiled with the  CHECK­
       ROOT=1  option, the password given is also checked against
       the systems root password.

       After updating the passwd file  and  returning  a  success
       notification  to  the  client,  rpc.yppasswdd executes the
       pwupdate script that updates the NIS server's passwd.* and
       shadow.byname  maps.  This script assumes all NIS maps are
       kept in directories named /var/yp/nisdomain that each con­
       tain a Makefile customized for that NIS domain. If no such
       Makefile is found, the scripts uses  the  generic  one  in
       /var/yp.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -D directory
              The  passwd  and shadow files are located under the
              specified directory path.  rpc.yppasswdd  will  use
              this  files, not /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.  This
              is useful if you do not want to give all  users  in
              the  NIS  database  automatic  access  to  your NIS
              server.

       -E program
              Instead  of  rpc.yppasswdd  editing  the  passwd  &
              shadow  files, the specified program will be run to
              do the editing. The following environment variables
              will   be   set  for  the  program:  YP_PASSWD_OLD,
              YP_PASSWD_NEW,  YP_USER,  YP_GECOS,  YP_SHELL.  The
              program  should  return  an exit status of 0 if the
              change completes successfully, 1 if the change com­
              pletes successfully but pwupdate should not be run,
              and otherwise if the change fails.

       -p passwdfile
              This options tells rpc.yppasswdd to use a different
              source  file  instead of /etc/passwd This is useful
              if you do not want to give all  users  in  the  NIS
              database automatic access to your NIS server.

       -s shadowfile
              This options tells rpc.yppasswdd to use a different
              source file instead of /etc/passwd. See below for a
              brief discussion of shadow support.

       -e [chsh|chfn]
              By  default,  rpc.yppasswdd will not allow users to
              change the shell or GECOS  field  of  their  passwd
              entry.  Using  the -e option, you can enable either
              of these.  Note  that  when  enabling  support  for
              ypchsh(1),  you  have  to list all shells users are
              allowed to select in /etc/shells.

       -x program
              When the -x option is used, rpc.yppasswdd will  not
              attempt  to  modify  any  files  itself,  but  will
              instead run the specified program, passing  to  its
              stdin information about the requested operation(s).
              There is a defined  protocol  used  to  communicate
              with this external program, which has total freedom
              in how it propagates the change request. See  below
              for more details on this.

       -m     Will  be  ignored,  for  compatibility with Solaris
              only.

       --port number
              rpc.yppasswdd will try to register itself  to  this
              port. This makes it  possible to have a router fil­
              ter packets to the NIS ports.

       -v --version
              Prints the version number and if  this  package  is
              compiled with the CHECKROOT option.

MISCELLANEOUS
   Shadow Passwords
       Using  Shadow  passwords  alongside  NIS does not make too
       much sense, because the supposedly  inaccesible  passwords
       now   become  readable  through  a  simple  invocation  of
       ypcat(1).

       Shadow support in rpc.yppasswdd  does  not  mean  that  it
       offers  a  very clever solution to this problem, it simply
       means that it can read and write password entries  in  the
       system's shadow file.  You have to produce a shadow.byname
       NIS map to distribute password  information  to  your  NIS
       clients.   rpc.yppasswdd  will  search  at  first  in  the
       /etc/passwd file for the user and password. If  it  find's
       the  user,  but the password is "x" and a /etc/shadow file
       exists, it will update the password in the shadow map.

   Use of the -x option
       The program should expect  to  read  a  single  line  from
       stdin, which is formatted as follows:

       <username> o:<oldpass> p:<password> s:<shell> g:<gcos>\n

       where  any of the three fields [p, s, g] may or may not be
       present.

       This program should write "OK\n" to stdout if  the  opera­
       tion  succeeded.   On any other result, rpc.yppasswdd will
       report failure to the client.

       Note that the  program  specified  by  the  -x  option  is
       responsible  for  doing  any  NIS  make and build, and for
       doing any necessary validation on the shell and gcos field
       information  supplied.   The password passed to the client
       will be in UNIX crypt() format.

   Logging
       rpc.yppasswdd logs all password update  requests  to  sys­
       logd(8)'s  auth facility. The logging information includes
       the originating host's IP address and the  user  name  and
       UID  contained  in the request. The user-supplied password
       itself is not logged.

   Security
       Unless I've screwed up completely (as I did with  versions
       prior  to  version 0.5), rpc.yppasswdd should be as secure
       or insecure as any  program  relying  on  simple  password
       authentication.   If you feel that this is not enough, you
       may want to protect rpc.yppasswdd from outside  access  by
       using  the `securenets' feature of the new portmap(8) ver­
       sion 3.  Better still, use Kerberos.
