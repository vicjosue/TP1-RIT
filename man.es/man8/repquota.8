REPQUOTA(8)                                           REPQUOTA(8)



NAME
       repquota - summarize quotas for a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/repquota  [ -vtsug ] [ -F format-name ] filesys­
       tem...

       /usr/sbin/repquota [ -avtsug ] [ -F format-name ]

DESCRIPTION
       repquota prints a summary of the disc usage and quotas for
       the  specified  file  systems.   For each user the current
       number of files and amount  of  space  (in  kilobytes)  is
       printed, along with any quotas created with edquota(8).

OPTIONS
       -a     Report on all filesystems indicated in /etc/mtab to
              be read-write with quotas.

       -v     Report all quotas, even if there is  no  usage.  Be
              also more verbose about quotafile information.

       -t     Truncate user/group names longer than 9 characters.
              This results in nicer output when  there  are  such
              names.

       -s     Try to report used space, number of used inodes and
              limits in more appropriate units than default ones.

       -F format-name
              Report  quota  for specified format (ie. don't per­
              form format autodetection).  Possible format  names
              are:  vfsold  (version  1  quota), vfsv0 (version 2
              quota), rpc (quota over NFS),  xfs  (quota  on  XFS
              filesystem)

       -g     Report quotas for groups.

       -u     Report quotas for users. This is the default.

       Only  the  super-user  may view quotas which are not their
       own.

FILES
       aquota.user or aquota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root
                           (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user or quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root
                           (version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
       /etc/mtab           default filesystems
       /etc/passwd         default set of users
       /etc/passwd         default set of groups
