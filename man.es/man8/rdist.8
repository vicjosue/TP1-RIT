DESCRIPTION
       Rdistd is the server program for the rdist command.  It is
       normally run by rdist via rsh(1).

       The -S argument must be specified.  The option is required
       so  that  rdistd is not accidentally started since it nor­
       mally resides somewhere in a normal user's $PATH.

              syslog(3).
