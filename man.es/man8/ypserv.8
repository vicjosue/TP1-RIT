YPSERV(8)                Reference Manual               YPSERV(8)



NAME
       ypserv - NIS server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/ypserv [ -b ] [ -d [ path ] ] [ -p port ]


DESCRIPTION
       The  Network  Information  Service (NIS) provides a simple
       network lookup service consisting of  databases  and  pro­
       cesses.   The databases are gdbm files in a directory tree
       rooted at /var/yp.

       The  ypserv  daemon  is  typically  activated  at   system
       startup.   ypserv  runs only on NIS server machines with a
       complete NIS database. On other  machines  using  the  NIS
       services,  you have to run ypbind as client or under Linux
       you could use the libc with NYS support.  ypbind must  run
       on  every  machine  which has NIS client processes; ypserv
       may or may not be running on the same node,  but  must  be
       running  somewhere  on  the  network.  On  startup or when
       receiving  the  signal  SIGHUP,  ypserv  parses  the  file
       /etc/ypserv.conf.


OPTIONS
       -d --debug [path]
              Causes  the  server  to run in debugging mode. Nor­
              mally, ypserv reports only  errors  (access  viola­
              tions,  dbm failures) using the syslog(3) facility.
              In debug  mode,  the  server  does  not  background
              itself  and  prints extra status messages to stderr
              for each request that it  revceives.   path  is  an
              optionally  parameter.  ypserv is using this direc­
              tory instead of /var/yp

       -b --dns
              If we don't find the host in  the  hosts  maps,  we
              query  the  DNS  (Domain  Name Service) service for
              more host information. This is  done  in  an  extra
              subprocess.  ypserv ignores the YP_INTERDOMAIN keys
              for dns lookup.

       -p --port port
              ypserv will bind itself to this port.   This  makes
              it  possible to have a router filter packets to the
              NIS ports, so that access to the  NIS  server  from
              hosts on the Internet can be restricted.

       -v --version
              Prints the version number

SECURITY
       In general, any remote user can issue an RPC to ypserv and
       retrieve the contents of your NIS maps, if he  knows  your
       domain  name.  To  prevent such unauthorized transactions,
       ypserv supports a feature called securenets which  can  be
       used  to  restrict  access  to  a  given set of hosts.  At
       startup or when arriving the SIGHUP  Signal,  ypserv  will
       attempt  to  load  the  securenets information from a file
       called /var/yp/securenets .  This  file  contains  entries
       that  consist of a netmask and a network pair separated by
       white spaces.  Lines starting with ``#'' are considered to
       be comments.

       A sample securenets file might look like this:

              # allow connections from local host -- necessary
              host 127.0.0.1
              # same as 255.255.255.255 127.0.0.1
              #
              # allow connections from any host
              # on the 131.234.223.0 network
              255.255.255.0   131.234.223.0
              # allow connections from any host
              # between 131.234.214.0 and 131.234.215.255
              255.255.254.0   131.234.214.0

       If ypserv receives a request from an address that fails to
       match a rule, the request will be ignored  and  a  warning
       message  will  be  logged.  If the /var/yp/securenets file
       does not exist, ypserv will  allow  connections  from  any
       host.

       In  the  /etc/ypserv.conf  you  could  specify some access
       rules for special maps and  hosts.  But  it  is  not  very
       secure,  it  makes the life only a little bit harder for a
       potential hacker. If  a  mapname  doesn't  match  a  rule,
       ypserv  will  look for the YP_SECURE key in the map. If it
       exists, ypserv will only  allow  requests  on  a  reserved
       port.

       For  security  reasons, ypserv will only accept ypproc_xfr
       requests for updating maps from the same master server  as
       the  old  one. This means, you have to reinstall the slave
       servers if you change the master server for a map.

       The  Network  Information Service (NIS) was formerly known
       as Sun Yellow Pages (YP).  The functionality  of  the  two
       remains  the  same;  only  the name has changed.  The name
       Yellow Pages is a registered trademark in the United King­
