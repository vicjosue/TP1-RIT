YPPUSH(8)                Reference Manual               YPPUSH(8)



NAME
       yppush - force propagation of changed NIS databases

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/yppush  [ -d domain ] [ -t timeout ] [ -p # par­
       allel jobs ] [ -h host ] [ -v ] mapname ...


DESCRIPTION
       yppush copies updated NIS databases  (or  maps)  from  the
       master  NIS  server  to  the  slave  servers  within a NIS
       domain. It is normally run  only  on  the  NIS  master  by
       /var/yp/Makefile  after  the master databases are changed.
       /var/yp/Makefile does not invoke yppush  by  default,  the
       NOPUSH=true line must be commented out.
       yppush  first  constructs  a  list of NIS slave servers by
       reading the NIS map ypservers within the domain.  A desti­
       nation host (or a list of hosts with multiple -h commands)
       can also be specified on the command  line.   A  "transfer
       map"  request  is  sent  to  the NIS serger at each slave,
       along with the information needed by  the  transfer  agent
       ypxfr(8)  to  callback to yppush, which may be printed the
       result to stderr. Messages are also printed when a  trans­
       fer is not possible; for instance when the request message
       is undeliverable.

OPTIONS
       -d domain
              Specify a particular domain. The NIS domain of  the
              local  host system is used by default. If the local
              host's domain name is not set, the domain name must
              be specified with this flag.

       -t timeout
              The timeout flag is used to specify a timeout value
              in seconds. This timeout controls how  long  yppush
              will wait for a response from a slave server before
              sending a map transfer request to  the  next  slave
              server  in  the list.  By default, yppush will wait
              90 seconds. For big maps, this is not long  enough.

       -p # parallel jobs
              yppush  normally performs transfers serially, mean­
              ing that it will send a map transfer request to one
              slave server and then wait for it to respond before
              sending the next map transfer request to  the  next
              slave  server. In environments with many slaves, it
              is more efficient to initiate several map transfers
              at  once  so  that  the transfers can take place in
              parallel.

       -h host
              The host flag can be used to transfer a  map  to  a
              user-specified machine or group of machines instead
              of the list of servers contained in  the  ypservers
              map. A list of hosts can be specified by using mul­
              tiple instances of the -h flag.  -v  Verbose  mode:
              causes  yppush  to  print  debugging messages as it
              runs. Note specifying this flag twice makes  yppush
              even more verbose.

BUGS
       The  mechanism for transferring NIS maps in NIS v1 is dif­
       ferent that that in NIS version 2.  This  version  of  has
       support for transferring maps to NIS v2 systems only.
