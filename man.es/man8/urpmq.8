NAME
       urpmq - urpmi database query tool.

SYNOPSIS
       urpmq [options] [package_names | rpm_files...]

DESCRIPTION
       urpmq allows querying the urpmi database. It is for you if
       want to list available packages in the  various  media  of
       urpmi,  or  list dependancies of packages or packages that
       will be installed if you start urpmi.

       Output format of urpmq is the following according to  com­
       mand line options:

              [group/]package_name[-version][-release][.arch]

OPTIONS
       --help print an help message and exit (this is the same as
              -h or -?).

       --update
              use only update media. This means urpmq will search
              and  resolve  dependencies  only in media marked as
              update.

       --media
              select specific media to use instead of  all  media
              available (or update media is --updtae is used).

       --auto-select
              automatically  select  all packages that have to be
              upgraded according to  already  installed  packages
              and packages listed in various media registered.

       --fuzzy
              disable  fast  search  on exact package name, ie it
              will propose all package containing the  name  even
              if one has the given name (this is the same as -y).

       --src  next package name is a source package and  it  will
              select  all dependencies if urpmi is run as root or
              only install source package as simple user (this is
              the same as -s).

       --headers
              extract  headers  for  package selected to standard
              output.

       --sources
              print  source  url  (or  file)  of   all   packages
              selected.

       --force
              ignore error of inexistant packages requested.

       -v     activate verbose mode.

       -d     select dependancies (maximal closure).

       -u     deselect  packages  if  a better version is already
              installed, this option  can  be  used  with  -d  to
              simulate -M mode of urpmi.

       -c     if  maximal  closure is used, assume that a package
              listed mey have wrong or not  up-to-date  dependan­
              cies.  This  cause  more package to be upgraded and
              may correct  unresolved  dependancies  on  the  rpm
              database.

       -p     allow search in provides to find package.

       -P     do  not search in provides to find package (this is
              the opposite of -p and is the default).

       -y     this is the same as --fuzzy.

       -s     this is the same as --src.

       -g     print group of each packages listed.

       -r     print version and release of each packages  listed.

       -f     print  version,  release  and arch of each packages
              listed.
