DIALOUT(8)                                             DIALOUT(8)



NAME
       dialout - Configure and control PPP links

SYNOPSIS
       linuxconf --modulemain dialout [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  dialout  module  is a configurator for PPP links over
       modem and other facilities.  It  also  offers  interactive
       and command line solution to control the link.


OPTIONS
       Without  options,  the  configuration mode is started. You
       are presented with the list of PPP configurations. You can
       add  new ones and edit existing one. This dialog is avail­
       able from the linuxconf / networking / client tasks  menu.



       --connect config [ --fore ]
              triggers  a  link.  If  the  link is already up, do
              nothing. The command returns only when  either  the
              link  is  up  or  the  connection  has failed. This
              offers a nice way to do scripting. One can do:

              if linuxconf --modulemain dialout --connect config
              then
                   The link is up, do something
              else
                   The connection failed, do something else
              fi

              The --fore  parameter  controls  if  the  ppp  link
              should  stay  in foreground. This means the command
              returns only if the connection failed or  the  link
              ends.   This is useful to control a link from init­
              tab (5). One can use the following script to  reli­
              ably re-connect if the link ends.

              while true
              do
                   linuxconf --modulemain dialout config --fore
              done


       --dialctl
              triggers  the control panel for PPP configurations.
              From this screen you can turn on and off  PPP  con­
              nections.  You  also see which one is active.  This
              control panel is also available from the  linuxconf
              / control / control panel menu.


       --disconnect config
              terminate a PPP connection.


netconf
       The  dialout  module used to be part of Linuxconf core and
       the various command line options were available  from  the
       netconf  command.   netconf --connect config is equivalent
       to linuxconf --modulemain dialout config here.
