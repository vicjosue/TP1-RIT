NAME
       userhelper - A helper interface to pam.

SYNOPSIS
       userhelper   [ -t ]   [ -d  in,out,err ]  [ -w prog args ]
       [ -c ] [ -f full-name ] [ -o office ]  [ -p office-phone ]
       [ -h home-phone ] [ -s shell ] [ username ]


DESCRIPTION
       NOTE this program is NOT intended to be run interactively.
       If you want to change this information on the command line
       use passwd(1), chfn(1), or chsh(1).

       This program provides a basic interface to change a user's
       password, gecos information, and shell.  The main  differ­
       nce  between  this program and its traditional equivilents
       is that prompts come out on standard out to make  it  easy
       for a GUI program to interface it as a child process.

       The output is in the form of:

       <number> <string>

       Where  the number is the type of prompt returned from pam­
       lib, and the string is the prompt to give the user.

       The prompt numbers are as follows:

       1      Prompt with visible input.

       2      Prompt with invisible input.

       3      Informational message.

       4      Error message.

       5      Count of messages sent in this block so far.

       6      The name of the service being used.

       7      Whether or not the command will be executed as  the
              user if authentication fails.

       8      The name of the user being authenticated.


OPTIONS
       -d     A  comma-separated  list of three descriptors which
              need to  be  reattached  to  the  standard  handles
              before  the command is executed; only used with -w.

       -t     Text mode authentication instead  of  the  numbered
              message types just described; only used with -w.

       -w     Specify  a  program name and arguments to be passed
              through.  userhelper  will  look  up  in  the  file
              /etc/security/console.apps/programname the username
              to authenticate stored as USER=value (value is nor­
              mally  "root"  or  the  magic  token "<user>" which
              indicates to authenticate the current user) and the
              program  to run stored as PROGRAM=value (value must
              be an absolute path or it  will  be  ignored).   If
              USER  is  not  specified, the current user is used,
              and if PROGRAM is not specified,  userhelper  looks
              for  programname  in  /sbin  and /usr/sbin/.  user­
              helper will then authenticate the user via pam  and
              then  run  the  named  program.  If SESSION=true is
              specified, then userhelper establishes a  pam  ses­
              sion and forks and execs, then waits around for the
              child to  exit;  otherwise,  it  simply  execs  the
              child.  userhelper is normally called from console­
              helper via a symlink.  If FALLBACK=true  is  speci­
              fied,  the  program will run as user if authentica­
              tion fails.  Authentication will be  retried  twice
              (three  times  total)  unless  something other than
              RETRY=2 is specified.

       -c     Change the current user's password.  Note that this
              option  cannot  be  used  with  any  of  the  other
              options.  This is due  to  the  limitation  in  the
              interface to pamlib.

       -f     Specify a new Full Name.

       -o     Specify a new Office.

       -p     Specify a new Office Phone.

       -h     Specify a new Home Phone.

       -s     Specify a new shell.

EXIT STATUS
       A  non-zero exit status indicates an error occured.  Those
       errors are:

       1      The authentication passwords was incorrect.

       2      One or more of the GECOS fields is  invalid.   This
              occurs when there is a colon supplied in one of the
              fields.

       3      Password resetting error.

       4      Some system files are locked.

       5      User unknown.

       6      Insufficent rights.

       7      Invalid call to this program.

       8      The shell provided is not  valid  (i.e.,  does  not
              exist in /etc/shells).

       9      Ran out of memory.

       10     Could not find the program.

       11     exec failed even though program exists.

       255    Unknown error.

FILES
       /etc/passwd              The  gecos  and shell information
                                is stored in this file.

       /etc/shells              This file is checked  to  see  if
                                the  new shell supplied is valid.
