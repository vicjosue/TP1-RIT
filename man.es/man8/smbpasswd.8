NAME
       smbpasswd - change a user's SMB password

SYNOPSIS
       smbpasswd  [ -a ]  [ -x ]  [ -d ]  [ -e ]  [ -D debuglevel
       ]  [ -n ]  [ -r <remote machine> ]   [  -R  <name  resolve
       order>  ]  [ -m ]  [ -j DOMAIN ]  [ -U username[%password]
       ]  [ -h ]  [ -s ]  [ -w pass ]  [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.

       The smbpasswd program  has  several  different  functions,
       depending  on  whether  it is run by the root user or not.
       When run as a normal user it allows the user to change the
       password  used for their SMB sessions on any machines that
       store SMB passwords.

       By default (when run with no arguments) it will attempt to
       change  the  current  user's  SMB  password  on  the local
       machine. This is similar to the way the passwd(1)  program
       works.   smbpasswd  differs  from  how  the passwd program
       works however in that it is not setuid root but works in a
       client-server mode and communicates with a locally running
       smbd(8). As a consequence in order for this to succeed the
       smbd  daemon  must  be  running on the local machine. On a
       UNIX machine  the  encrypted  SMB  passwords  are  usually
       stored in the smbpasswd(5) file.

       When  run  by  an ordinary user with no options. smbpasswd
       will prompt them for their old SMB password and  then  ask
       them  for their new password twice, to ensure that the new
       password was typed correctly. No passwords will be  echoed
       on  the screen whilst being typed. If you have a blank SMB
       password (specified by the string  "NO  PASSWORD"  in  the
       smbpasswd file) then just press the <Enter> key when asked
       for your old password.

       smbpasswd can also be used by  a  normal  user  to  change
       their  SMB password on remote machines, such as Windows NT
       Primary Domain Controllers. See the (-r)  and  -U  options
       below.

       When  run  by root, smbpasswd allows new users to be added
       and deleted in the  smbpasswd  file,  as  well  as  allows
       changes  to  the attributes of the user in this file to be
       made. When run by root, smbpasswd accesses the local  smb­
       passwd  file  directly,  thus  enabling changes to be made
       even if smbd is not running.

OPTIONS
       -a     This option specifies that the  username  following
              should  be  added to the local smbpasswd file, with
              the new password typed (type <Enter>  for  the  old
              password).  This  option is ignored if the username
              following already exists in the smbpasswd file  and
              it  is  treated like a regular change password com­
              mand. Note that the user to be added  must  already
              exist   in   the   system  password  file  (usually
              /etc/passwd) else the request to add the user  will
              fail.

              This  option  is  only  available when running smb­
              passwd as root.

       -x     This option specifies that the  username  following
              should be deleted from the local smbpasswd file.

              This  option  is  only  available when running smb­
              passwd as root.

       -d     This option specifies that the  username  following
              should  be  disabled  in  the local smbpasswd file.
              This is done by writing a 'D' flag into the account
              control  space  in the smbpasswd file. Once this is
              done all attempts to  authenticate  via  SMB  using
              this username will fail.

              If  the smbpasswd file is in the 'old' format (pre-
              Samba 2.0 format) there is no space in  the  user's
              password entry to write this information and so the
              user is disabled by writing 'X' characters into the
              password  space  in  the  smbpasswd  file. See smb­
              passwd(5) for details on the 'old' and new password
              file formats.

              This  option  is  only  available when running smb­
              passwd as root.

       -e     This option specifies that the  username  following
              should  be  enabled in the local smbpasswd file, if
              the account was previously disabled. If the account
              was  not  disabled  this option has no effect. Once
              the account is enabled then the user will  be  able
              to authenticate via SMB once again.

              If  the smbpasswd file is in the 'old' format, then
              smbpasswd will prompt for a new password  for  this
              user,  otherwise  the  account  will  be enabled by
              removing the 'D' flag from account control space in
              the   smbpasswd file. See smbpasswd (5) for details
              on the 'old' and new password file formats.

              This option is only  available  when  running  smb­
              passwd as root.

       -D debuglevel
              debuglevel  is an integer from 0 to 10. The default
              value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

              The higher this value,  the  more  detail  will  be
              logged  to  the  log  files about the activities of
              smbpasswd. At level 0,  only  critical  errors  and
              serious warnings will be logged.

              Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts
              of log data, and should only be used when  investi­
              gating  a  problem. Levels above 3 are designed for
              use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of
              log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

       -n     This  option  specifies that the username following
              should have their password  set  to  null  (i.e.  a
              blank  password)  in the local smbpasswd file. This
              is done by writing the string "NO PASSWORD" as  the
              first part of the first password stored in the smb­
              passwd file.

              Note that to allow users to logon to a Samba server
              once  the password has been set to "NO PASSWORD" in
              the smbpasswd file the administrator must  set  the
              following  parameter in the [global] section of the
              smb.conf file :

              null passwords = yes

              This option is only  available  when  running  smb­
              passwd as root.

       -r remote machine name
              This  option  allows a user to specify what machine
              they wish to change their password on. Without this
              parameter smbpasswd defaults to the local host. The
              remote machine name is  the  NetBIOS  name  of  the
              SMB/CIFS  server to contact to attempt the password
              change. This name is resolved into  an  IP  address
              using the standard name resolution mechanism in all
              programs of  the  Samba  suite.  See  the  -R  name
              resolve  order  parameter  for  details on changing
              this resolving mechanism.

              The username whose password is changed is  that  of
              the  current  UNIX logged on user. See the -U user­
              name parameter for details on changing the password
              for a different username.

              Note  that if changing a Windows NT Domain password
              the remote machine specified must  be  the  Primary
              Domain  Controller  for  the  domain (Backup Domain
              Controllers only have a read-only copy of the  user
              account  database  and  will not allow the password
              change).

              Note that Windows 95/98 do not have a real password
              database  so it is not possible to change passwords
              specifying a Win95/98  machine  as  remote  machine
              target.

       -R name resolve order
              This  option allows the user of smbpasswd to deter­
              mine what name  resolution  services  to  use  when
              looking  up the NetBIOS name of the host being con­
              nected to.

              The options  are  :"lmhosts",  "host",  "wins"  and
              "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows
              :

              · lmhosts : Lookup  an  IP  address  in  the  Samba
                lmhosts  file. If the line in lmhosts has no name
                type  attached  to  the  NetBIOS  name  (see  the
                lmhosts(5)for details) then any name type matches
                for lookup.

              · host : Do a standard host name to IP address res­
                olution,  using  the  system /etc/hosts , NIS, or
                DNS lookups. This method of  name  resolution  is
                operating system depended for instance on IRIX or
                Solaris this may be controlled by  the  /etc/nss­
                witch.conf  file).  Note that this method is only
                used if the NetBIOS name type  being  queried  is
                the  0x20  (server)  name  type,  otherwise it is
                ignored.

              · wins : Query a name with the IP address listed in
                the  wins server parameter. If no WINS server has
                been specified this method will be ignored.

              · bcast : Do a broadcast on each of the known local
                interfaces  listed  in  the interfaces parameter.
                This is the least reliable of the name resolution
                methods as it depends on the target host being on
                a locally connected subnet.

       The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and  with­
       out  this  parameter or any entry in the smb.conf file the
       name resolution methods will be attempted in this order.


       -m     This option tells smbpasswd that the account  being
              changed  is  a  MACHINE  account. Currently this is
              used when Samba is being  used  as  an  NT  Primary
              Domain Controller.

              This  option  is  only  available when running smb­
              passwd as root.

       -j DOMAIN
              This option is used to add a Samba  server  into  a
              Windows  NT  Domain,  as a Domain member capable of
              authenticating user accounts  to  any  Domain  Con­
              troller in the same way as a Windows NT Server. See
              the security = domain option in the smb.conf(5) man
              page.

              This  command can work both with and without the -U
              parameter.

              When invoked with -U, that username  (and  optional
              password)  are  used to contact the PDC (which must
              be specified with -r)  to  both  create  a  machine
              account, and to set a password on it.

              Alternately,  if  -U is omitted, Samba will contact
              its PDC and attempt to change  the  password  on  a
              pre-existing account.

              In  order to be used in this way, the Administrator
              for the Windows NT Domain must have used  the  pro­
              gram  "Server  Manager for Domains" to add the pri­
              mary NetBIOS name of the Samba server as  a  member
              of the Domain.

              After this has been done, to join the Domain invoke
              smbpasswd with this parameter. smbpasswd will  then
              look  up  the  Primary  Domain  Controller  for the
              Domain (found in the smb.conf file in the parameter
              password  server  and  change  the  machine account
              password used to create the secure Domain  communi­
              cation.

              Either  way,  this  password is then stored by smb­
              passwd in a TDB, writeable  only  by  root,  called
              secrets.tdb

              Once   this   operation   has  been  performed  the
              smb.conf file may be updated to set the  security =
              domain  option  and  all future logins to the Samba
              server will be authenticated to the Windows NT PDC.

              Note  that  even though the authentication is being
              done to the  PDC  all  users  accessing  the  Samba
              server must still have a valid UNIX account on that
              machine.  The winbindd(8) daemon  can  be  used  to
              create UNIX accounts for NT users.

              This  option  is  only  available when running smb­
              passwd as root.

       -U username
              This option may only be used  in  conjunction  with
              the -r option. When changing a password on a remote
              machine it allows the user to specify the user name
              on  that machine whose password will be changed. It
              is present to allow users who have  different  user
              names  on  different  systems to change these pass­
              words.

              In particular, this parameter specifies  the  user­
              name  used  to  create  the  machine  account  when
              invoked with -j

       -h     This option prints the help string for   smbpasswd,
              selecting the correct one for running as root or as
              an ordinary user.

       -s     This option causes smbpasswd  to  be  silent  (i.e.
              not  issue  prompts)  and  to  read its old and new
              passwords from standard  input,  rather  than  from
              /dev/tty  (like  the  passwd(1) program does). This
              option is to aid people writing  scripts  to  drive
              smbpasswd

       -w password
              This  parameter is only available is Samba has been
              configured to use the  experimental  --with-ldapsam
              option.  The -w switch is used to specify the pass­
              word to be used with the ldap admin dn.  Note  that
              the  password  is stored in the private/secrets.tdb
              and is keyed off of the admin's DN. This means that
              if  the  value  of  ldap admin dn ever changes, the
              password will beed to be manually updated as  well.

       username
              This  specifies  the  username  for all of the root
              only options to operate on. Only root  can  specify
              this  parameter  as  only  root  has the permission
              needed to modify attributes directly in  the  local
              smbpasswd file.

NOTES
       Since  smbpasswd works in client-server mode communicating
       with a local smbd for a non-root user then the smbd daemon
       must  be  running for this to work. A common problem is to
       add a restriction to the hosts that may access  the   smbd
       running  on  the local machine by specifying a allow hosts
       or deny hosts entry in the smb.conf file and neglecting to
       allow "localhost" access to the smbd.

       In addition, the smbpasswd command is only useful if Samba
       has been set up to use encrypted passwords. See  the  file
       ENCRYPTION.txt in the docs directory for details on how to
       do this.
