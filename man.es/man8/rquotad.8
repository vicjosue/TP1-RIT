NAME
       rquotad, rpc.rquotad - remote quota server

SYNOPSIS
       rpc.rquotad

DESCRIPTION
       rquotad  is  an  rpc(3N) server which returns quotas for a
       user of a local filesystem which is mounted  by  a  remote
       machine over the NFS.  It also allows setting of quotas on
       NFS mounted filesystem. The results are used  by  quota(1)
       to  display  user  quotas  for  remote  filesystems and by
       edquota(8) to set quotas on remote filesystems.  The rquo­
       tad  daemon is normally started at boot time from the sys­
       tem startup scripts.
