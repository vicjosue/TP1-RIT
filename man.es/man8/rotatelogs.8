NAME
       rotatelogs - rotate Apache logs without having to kill the
       server

SYNOPSIS
       rotatelogs logfile rotationtime [offset]


DESCRIPTION
       rotatelogs is a simple program for use in conjunction with
       Apache's  piped  logfile  feature  which  can be used like
       this:

          TransferLog  "|   rotatelogs   /path/to/logs/access_log
       86400"

       This creates the files /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn where
       nnnn is the system time at which the log nominally  starts
       (this time will always be a multiple of the rotation time,
       so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the  end
       of  each  rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is
       started.

OPTIONS
       logfile
              The path plus basename of the logfile.  If  logfile
              includes  any  Otherwise, the suffix .nnnn is auto­
              matically added and is the time at which  the  log­
              file was created.

       rotationtime
              The rotation time in seconds.

       offset The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted,
              zero is assumed and UTC is used.  For  example,  to
              use  local time in the zone UTC -5 hours, specify a
              value of -300 for this argument.
