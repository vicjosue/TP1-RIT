ASKRUNLEVEL(8)                                     ASKRUNLEVEL(8)



NAME
       askrunlevel - Selects operation mode at boot time

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/askrunlevel

DESCRIPTION
       askrunlevel  is generally called at the end of the initial
       boot script, just before jumping to  the  proper  runlevel
       (enabling  multi-user).  The command does some cleanup for
       Linuxconf and prints the following message

       Hit any key to enter Linuxconf configuration mode
       Hit <Enter> to resume the boot sequence
       The boot sequence will resume in 20 seconds

       The configuration mode allows you to perform the following
       task:

       Select the graphical option mode (runlevel 5 generally)
       Select the text operation mode
       Configure the workstation (enter linuxconf main menu)
       Select a system profile
       Enter maintenance mode (a shell with nothing else running)

       askrunlevel is currently a symbolic  link  to  /bin/linux­
       conf.
