NAME
       smbumount - smbfs umount for normal users

SYNOPSIS
       smbumount mount-point

DESCRIPTION
       With  this  program, normal users can unmount smb-filesys­
       tems, provided that it is suid root.  smbumount  has  been
       written to give normal Linux users more control over their
       resources. It is safe to install this program  suid  root,
       because  only  the  user  who  has mounted a filesystem is
       allowed to unmount it again.  For root it is not necessary
       to  use  smbumount.  The  normal umount program works per­
       fectly well, but it would certainly be problematic to make
       umount setuid root.

OPTIONS
       mount-point
              The directory to unmount.
