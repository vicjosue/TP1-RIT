NAME
       vregistry - get/set virtual variables

SYNOPSIS
       vregistry [ UI options ] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       vregistry  is  a small Linuxconf module manipulating vari­
       ables in the virtual registry. Linuxconf handles  directly
       system  configuration file, but provides a generic mean to
       set or retrieve information out of those files. Configura­
       tion  files  are  mapped  as  a  set  of  variables easily
       accessed.

       The virtual registry is also available within  modules  so
       they  can  inpsect other modules information. As such, the
       vregistry is a rather simple module.


VARIABLES
       A variable name has the following format:

       system.key[.record-id]



OPTIONS
       --list
              presents all known variables in alphabetic  orders.
              Variables  ending  with  .*   refer  to an array of
              records. You must replace the .* by some record ID.

              The  virtual  registry  is  tied  to Linuxconf user
              interface toolkit. In fact each variable is  linked
              to  a field of one dialog. As such, it inherits the
              same ability to parse, update and validate  inputs.

              The  --list  option  presents  all  variable with a
              small  description.  The   description   is   taken
              directly  in corresponding dialog. So if a variable
              seems confusing,  check  the  corresponding  dialog
              interactively  and  you  will  have a better under­
              standing of its purpose.


       --get variable [ variable ... ]
              retrieves the value of one  or  several  variables.
              The  values  are presented one value per line using
              the format

              variable=value


       --getvalue variable [ variable ... ]
              retrieves the value of one  or  several  variables.
              Unlike  the  --get option, only the value are print
              out, without the variable name. This is more conve­
              nient  when  you want to reuse the value in a shell
              script, using back quote.


       --set variable value [ variable value ... ]
              sets variables. Several variables may be  specified
              at  once. This is often needed. For example, if you
              set some variables for a new configuration,  Linux­
              conf may refuse to produce an incomplete configura­
              tion file. By specifying several variable, you  can
              set  all  the  relevant  parts of the configuration
              before it is checked and saved.
