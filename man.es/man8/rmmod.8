RMMOD(8)               Linux Module Support              RMMOD(8)



NAME
       rmmod - unload loadable modules

SYNOPSIS
       rmmod [ -aehrsvV ] module ...

DESCRIPTION
       rmmod unloads loadable modules from the running kernel.

       rmmod  tries  to  unload a set of modules from the kernel,
       with the restriction that they are not  in  use  and  that
       they are not referred to by other modules.

       If  more than one module is named on the command line, the
       modules will be removed in the given order. This  supports
       unloading of stacked modules.

       With  the  option '-r' a recursive removal of modules will
       be attempted.  This means that if a top module in a  stack
       is named on the command line, all modules that are used by
       this module will be removed as well, if possible.


   OPTIONS
       -a --all
              Do  autoclean:  tag  unused  modules  as   "to   be
              cleaned",  and  also remove already tagged modules.
              Modules stay  tagged  if  they  stay  unused  since
              previous   autoclean.    These   two  passes  avoid
              removing transiently unused modules.

       -e --persist
              Save persistent data for the named modules, without
              unloading  any  modules.   If  no  module names are
              specified then data is saved for all  modules  that
              have  persistent  data.  Data is only saved if both
              the kernel and modutils support persistent data and
              /proc/ksyms contains an entry
              __insmod_modulename_Ppersistent_filename

       -h --help
              Print the help text.

       -r --stacks
              Remove a module stack.

       -s --syslog
              Output  everything  to  syslog(3)  instead  of  the
              terminal.

       -v --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -V --version
              Print the version of modutils.

PERSISTENT DATA
       If a module contains persistent data  (see  insmod(8)  and
       modules.conf(5))  then  removing  the module always writes
       the persistent data to the filename  in  the  __insmod  _P
       symbol  entry.   You  can also save the persistent data at
       any time by rmmod -e, this will not unload any modules.

       When the  persistent  data  is  written  to  file,  it  is
       preceded by a generated comment line,
       #% kernel_version timestamp
       Generated  comment  lines  start  with '#%', all generated
       comments  are  stripped  from  the  existing  file,  other
       comments are preserved.  The saved data values are written
       to the file, preserving the existing order of comments and
       assignments.  New values are added at the end of the file.
       If the file contains values  that  do  not  exist  in  the
       module then these values are preserved but are preceded by
       a generated comment warning that they are not being  used.
       The  latter  operation  allows  a  user  to switch between
       kernels without losing persistent data and without getting
       any error messages.

       Note: Comments are only supported when the first non-space
       character on a line is '#'.  Any non-blank lines  that  do
       not  start with '#' are module options, one per line.  The
       option lines have leading spaces removed, the remainder of
       the  line  is passed to insmod as an option, including any
       trailing characters.
