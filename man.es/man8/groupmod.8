NAME
       groupmod - Modify a group

SYNOPSIS
       groupmod [-g gid [-o]] [-n group_name ] group

DESCRIPTION
       The  groupmod command modifies the system account files to
       reflect the changes that  are  specified  on  the  command
       line.  The options which apply to the groupmod command are

       -g gid The numerical value of the group's ID.  This  value
              must  be unique, unless the -o option is used.  The
              value must be non-negative.  Values between  0  and
              99  are  typically reserved for system groups.  Any
              files which the old group ID is the file  group  ID
              must have the file group ID changed manually.

       -n group_name
              The name of the group will be changed from group to
              group_name.
