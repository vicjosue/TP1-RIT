SMBMOUNT(8)                                           SMBMOUNT(8)



NAME
       smbmount - mount an smbfs filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       smbumount service mount-point [ -o options ]

DESCRIPTION
       smbmount  mounts  a  Linux  SMB  filesystem. It is usually
       invoked as mount.smbfs by the mount(8) command when  using
       the  "-t  smbfs" option. This command only works in Linux,
       and the kernel must support the smbfs filesystem.

       Options to smbmount are  specified  as  a  comma-separated
       list  of  key=value  pairs. It is possible to send options
       other than those listed here, assuming that smbfs supports
       them. If you get mount failures, check your kernel log for
       errors on unknown options.

       smbmount is a daemon.  After  mounting  it  keeps  running
       until  the  mounted  smbfs is umounted. It will log things
       that happen when in daemon mode using the  "machine  name"
       smbmount, so typically this output will end up in log.smb­
       mount.  The  smbmount   process   may   also   be   called
       mount.smbfs.

       NOTE: smbmount calls smbmnt(8) to do the actual mount. You
       must make sure that smbmnt is in the path so that  it  can
       be found.

OPTIONS
       username=<arg>
              specifies  the  username  to connect as. If this is
              not given, then the environment variable   USER  is
              used.   This   option   can   also  take  the  form
              "user%password" or "user/workgroup" or  "user/work­
              group%password" to allow the password and workgroup
              to be specified as part of the username.

       password=<arg>
              specifies the SMB password. If this option  is  not
              given then the environment variable PASSWD is used.
              If it can find no password smbmount will prompt for
              a passeword, unless the guest option is given.

              Note  that  password  which  contain  the arguement
              delimiter character (i.e. a comma ',') will  failed
              to  be  parsed  correctly on the command line. How­
              ever, the same password defined in the PASSWD envi­
              ronment  variable or a credentials file (see below)
              will be read correctly.

       credentials=<filename>
              specifies a file that contains  a  username  and/or
              password. The format of the file is:


                        username = <value>
                        password = <value>



              This   is   preferred   over  having  passwords  in
              plaintext in a shared file, such as /etc/fstab.  Be
              sure to protect any credentials file properly.

       netbiosname=<arg>
              sets  the  source  NetBIOS name. It defaults to the
              local hostname.

       uid=<arg>
              sets the uid that will own all files on the mounted
              filesystem.   It may be specified as either a user­
              name or a numeric uid.

       gid=<arg>
              sets the gid that will own all files on the mounted
              filesystem.  It may be specified as either a group­
              name or a numeric gid.

       port=<arg>
              sets the remote SMB port  number.  The  default  is
              139.

       fmask=<arg>
              sets the file mask. This determines the permissions
              that remote files have  in  the  local  filesystem.
              The default is based on the current umask.

       dmask=<arg>
              sets  the  directory mask. This determines the per­
              missions that remote directories have in the  local
              filesystem.   The  default  is based on the current
              umask.

       debug=<arg>
              sets the debug level. This is useful  for  tracking
              down  SMB connection problems. A suggested value to
              start with is 4. If set too high there  will  be  a
              lot of output, possibly hiding the useful output.

       ip=<arg>
              sets the destination host or IP address.

       workgroup=<arg>
              sets the workgroup on the destination

       sockopt=<arg>
              sets  the  TCP  socket  options.  See  the smb.conf
              socket options option.

       scope=<arg>
              sets the NetBIOS scope

       guest  don't prompt for a password

       ro     mount read-only

       rw     mount read-write

       iocharset=<arg>
              sets the charset used by the Linux side  for  code­
              page to charset translations (NLS). Argument should
              be the name of a charset,  like  iso8859-1.  (Note:
              only kernel 2.4.0 or later)

       codepage=<arg>
              sets   the   codepage  the  server  uses.  See  the
              iocharset option. Example value cp850. (Note:  only
              kernel 2.4.0 or later)

       ttl=<arg>
              how long a directory listing is cached in millisec­
              onds (also affects visibility of file size and date
              changes).  A higher value means that changes on the
              server take longer to be noticed but  it  can  give
              better performance on large directories, especially
              over long distances. Default is  1000ms  but  some­
              thing  like  10000ms  (10 seconds) is probably more
              reasonable in many cases.  (Note: only kernel 2.4.2
              or later)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  variable  USER may contain the username of the person
       using the client. This information is  used  only  if  the
       protocol  level  is  high  enough to support session-level
       passwords. The variable can be used to set  both  username
       and password by using the format username%password.

       The variable PASSWD may contain the password of the person
       using the client. This information is  used  only  if  the
       protocol  level  is  high  enough to support session-level
       passwords.

       The variable PASSWD_FILE may contain  the  pathname  of  a
       file  to read the password from. A single line of input is
       read and used as the password.

BUGS
       Passwords and other options containing , can not  be  han­
       dled.  For passwords an alternative way of passing them is
       in a credentials file or in the PASSWD environment.

       The credentials file does not handle  usernames  or  pass­
       words with leading space.

       One smbfs bug is important enough to mention here, even if
       it is a bit misplaced:

       · Mounts sometimes stop working. This is usually caused by
         smbmount  terminating.  Since  smbfs  needs  smbmount to
         reconnect when the server disconnects,  the  mount  will
         eventually go dead. An umount/mount normally fixes this.
         At least 2 ways to trigger this bug are known.

       Note that the typical response to a bug report is  sugges­
       tion  to try the latest version first. So please try doing
       that first, and always include which versions you  use  of
       relevant  software  when  reporting  bugs (minimum: samba,
       kernel, distribution)

       source  tree  may  contain additional options and informa­
       tion.

       FreeBSD also has a smbfs, but it is not  related  to  smb­
       mount

       For  Solaris,  HP-UX  and  others  you may want to look at
       smbsh(1)or at other solutions, such as sharity or  perhaps
       replacing the SMB server with a NFS server.
