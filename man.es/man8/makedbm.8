NAME
       makedbm - create or dump a ypserv database file

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/yp/makedbm  [ -a | -r ] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -s ] [ -l
       ] [ -i YP_INPUT_NAME ] [ -o YP_OUTPUT_NAME ] [ -m  YP_MAS­
       TER_NAME ] inputfile dbname
       /usr/lib/yp/makedbm -u dbname
       /usr/lib/yp/makedbm -c
       /usr/lib/yp/makedbm --version

DESCRIPTION
       makedbm  takes  the  inputfile and converts it to a ypserv
       database file. In the moment, GDBM is  used  as  database.
       Each  line  of  the  input  file  is converted to a single
       record. All characters up to the first TAB  or  SPACE  are
       the  key,  and  the rest of the line is the data.  makedbm
       does not treat `#' as a special character.

OPTIONS
       -a     Special support for mail aliases. We  couldn't  use
              sendmail for it, since sendmail uses db, but ypserv
              gdbm as database format.

       -b     Insert the YP_INTERDOMAIN into  the  output.   This
              key  causes  ypserv(8) to use DNS for host name and
              address lookups for hosts not found in the maps.

       -c     send a YPPROC_CLEAR to the local  ypserv(8).   This
              causes ypserv to invalidate all cached entries.

       -l     Convert the keys of the given map to lower case.

       -i YP_INPUT_NAME
              Create  a special entry with the key YP_INPUT_NAME.

       -m YP_MASTER_NAME
              Create a special entry with the key YP_MASTER_NAME.
              If no master host name is specified, YP_MASTER_NAME
              will be set to the local host name.

       -o YP_OUTPUT_NAME
              Create a special entry with the key YP_OUTPUT_NAME.

       -r     Handle  `#' as comment sign and remove the comment.

       -s     Secure map. Accept connections from secure NIS net­
              works only (reserved ports).

       -u dbname
              Dump a ypserv database file. Prints out the file in
              text format, one entry  per  line,  with  a  single
              space separating keys from values.

       --no-limit-check
              Don't check for NIS key and data limit.
