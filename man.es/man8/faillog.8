FAILLOG(8)                                             FAILLOG(8)



NAME
       faillog - examine faillog and set login failure limits

SYNOPSIS
       faillog [-u login-name] [-a] [-t days] [-m max] [-pr]

DESCRIPTION
       faillog   formats   the   contents  of  the  failure  log,
       /var/log/faillog, and maintains failure counts and limits.
       The  order  of  the  arguments  to faillog is significant.
       Each argument is processed immediately in the order given.

       The  -p  flag  causes failure entries to be printed in UID
       order.  Entering -u login-name flag will cause the failure
       record  for  login-name  only  to be printed.  Entering -t
       days will cause only the failures more recent than days to
       be  printed.  The -t flag overrides the use of -u.  The -a
       flag causes all users to be selected.  When used with  the
       -p flag, this option selects all users who have ever had a
       login failure.  It is meaningless with the -r flag.

       The -r flag is used to reset the count of login  failures.
       Write  access  to  /var/log/faillog  is  required for this
       option.  Entering -u login-name will cause only the  fail­
       ure count for login-name to be reset.

       The  -m  flag  is  used to set the maximum number of login
       failures before the account is disabled.  Write access  to
       /var/log/faillog is required for this option.  Entering -m
       max will cause all  accounts  to  be  disabled  after  max
       failed  logins occur.  This may be modified with -u login-
       name to limit this function to login-name only.  Selecting
       a  max value of 0 has the effect of not placing a limit on
       the number of failed logins.  The  maximum  failure  count
       should  always  be  0 for root to prevent a denial of ser­
       vices attack against the system.

       Options may be combined in virtually  any  fashion.   Each
       -p, -r, and -m option will cause immediate execution using
       any -u or -t modifier.

CAVEATS
       faillog only prints out users  with  no  successful  login
       since the last failure.  To print out a user who has had a
       successful  login  since  their  last  failure,  you  must
       explicitly request the user with the -u flag, or print out
       all users with the -a flag.

       Some  systems  may  replace  /var/log  with  /var/adm   or
       /usr/adm.
