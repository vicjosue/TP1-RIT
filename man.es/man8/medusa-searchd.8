MEDUSA-SEARCHD(8)                               MEDUSA-SEARCHD(8)



NAME
       medusa-searchd  -  daemon  to  perform  medusa file system
       searches

SYNOPSIS
       medusa-searchd [ -d | --debug ] [ -n indexname |  --named-
       index indexname ]

DESCRIPTION
       medusa-searchd,  which  is normally run automatically from
       an init script or crontab, puts itself into the background
       and  begins  listening  on  the  local socket /tmp/medusa-
       search-server.  It must be run as root.

       This seems to be the protocol:

       C:     gimme cookie \t uid \t pid \n

       S:     writing new cookie \n

       If the  response  for  the  server  is,  instead,  ``Index
       Error''  or  ``timeout error'' (with that capitalization),
       then the session has failed and is closed.

       Otherwise  the  client  then  tries  to  open   the   file
       /tmp/medusa-cookies/uid_pid   and   reads  a  single  int,
       encoded in the local binary format, from  it.   The  ASCII
       representation of that int is the cookie.

       C:     uid space pid space cookie \t search-uri

       where search-uri is as documented in medusa-search-uri(7).
       It does not seem to be terminated by a newline.

       S:     Search URI OK \n

       If  the  server   instead   responds,   ``Whole   Database
       Matches'',  ``Query  returned  no  results'', ``Search URI
       obsoletes index'', or ``Search URI syntax error'' then the
       session is over.

       Otherwise,  the  server  sends a series of matching patch­
       names, each terminated by a newline.  After the  last  the
       server sends

       S:     End \n

       and closes the connection.

OPTIONS
       --named-index indexname
              Use  socket /tmp/medusa-search-server-indexname and
              index   files   /var/lib/medusa-indextype-indexname
              rather   than   the  normal  versions  without  the
              ``-indexname'' suffix.

       --debug
              Stops medusa-searchd  from  going  into  the  back­
              ground,  and  causes  it to send a SIGINT signal to
              itself when printing warning messages.
