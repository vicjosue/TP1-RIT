NAME
       netconf - network client and server configuration

SYNOPSIS
       netconf [ UI options ] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       netconf is a short-cut to the Linuxconf network configura­
       tor. It provides numerous command line options.  Many  are
       used  internally  by  system scripts and are not useful to
       administrator directly.


OPTIONS
       --bootrc rc_dir_path [ previous_rc_dir_path]
              walks a system V init script runlevel directory and
              triggers  the start and stop scripts. It supports a
              timeout mechanism  allowing  the  administrator  to
              regain  control  if a script takes too long to pro­
              ceed.


       --connect
              --dialctl
              --disconnect
              --postconnect
              --predisconnect
              are short cuts to the dialout module command  line.
              See dialout (8) for details.


       --resetfw
              is a short cut to the firewall module command line.
              It turn off the firewall configuration.  Note  that
              linuxconf --update will turn it on again.


       --status
              is  equivalent  to  linuxconf --status.  See linux­
              conf(8).  Kept for compatibility  with  older  ver­
              sion.


       --update
              is  equivalent  to  linuxconf --update.  See linux­
              conf(8).  Kept for compatibility  with  older  ver­
              sion.
