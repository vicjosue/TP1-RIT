DESCRIPTION
       httpd  is  the  Apache  HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       server program. It is designed to be run as  a  standalone
       daemon  process. When used like this it will create a pool
       of child processes to handle requests. To stop it, send  a
       TERM  signal  to  the initial (parent) process. The PID of
       this process is written to a file as given in the configu­
       ration  file.   Alternatively  httpd may be invoked by the
       Internet daemon xinetd(8) each time a  connection  to  the
       HTTP service is made.

       This  manual  page  only lists the command line arguments.
       For details of the directives necessary to configure httpd
       see the Apache manual, which is part of the Apache distri­
       bution or can be found at http://httpd.apache.org/.  Paths
       in  this manual may not reflect those compiled into httpd.

OPTIONS
       -R libexecdir
                   This option is only available  if  Apache  was
                   built  with the SHARED_CORE rule enabled which
                   forces the Apache core code to be placed  into
                   a  dynamic shared object (DSO) file. This file
                   is searched in a hardcoded path under  Server­
                   Root  per default. Use this option if you want
                   to override it.

       -d serverroot
                   Set  the  initial  value  for  the  ServerRoot
                   directive  to serverroot. This can be overrid­
                   den by the ServerRoot command in the  configu­
                   ration file. The default is /usr/local/apache.

       -f config   Execute the commands in  the  file  config  on
                   startup.  If  config  does not begin with a /,
                   then it is taken to be a path relative to  the
                   ServerRoot. The default is conf/httpd.conf.

       -C directive
                   Process  the  configuration  directive  before
                   reading config files.

       -c directive
                   Process  the  configuration  directive   after
                   reading config files.

       -D parameter
                   Sets  a  configuration  parameter which can be
                   used with <IfDefine>...</IfDefine> sections in
                   the  configuration files to conditionally skip
                   or process commands.

       -h          Output a short summary  of  available  command
                   line options.

       -l          Output  a  list  of  modules compiled into the
                   server.

       -L          Output a  list  of  directives  together  with
                   expected arguments and places where the direc­
                   tive is valid.

       -S          Show the settings as parsed  from  the  config
                   file  (currently  only  shows  the virtualhost
                   settings).

       -t          Run syntax tests for configuration files only.
                   The program immediately exits after these syn­
                   tax parsing with either a  return  code  of  0
                   (Syntax  OK)  or  return  code  not equal to 0
                   (Syntax Error).

       -T          Same as option -t but does not check the  con­
                   figured document roots.

       -X          Run   in  single-process  mode,  for  internal
                   debugging purposes only; the daemon  does  not
                   detach from the terminal or fork any children.
                   Do NOT use this mode to provide  ordinary  web
                   service.

       -v          Print the version of httpd , and then exit.

       -V          Print  the  version  and  build  parameters of
                   httpd , and then exit.
