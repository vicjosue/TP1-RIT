rpc.statd(8)                                         rpc.statd(8)



NAME
       rpc.statd - NSM status monitor

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/rpc.statd [-F] [-d] [-?] [-n  name ] [-o  port ] [-p
       port ] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       The rpc.statd server implements the  NSM  (Network  Status
       Monitor) RPC protocol.  This service is somewhat misnomed,
       since it doesn't actually provide active monitoring as one
       might  suspect; instead, NSM implements a reboot notifica­
       tion service. It is used by the NFS file locking  service,
       rpc.lockd,  to implement lock recovery when the NFS server
       machine crashes and reboots.

   Operation
       For each NFS client or server  machine  to  be  monitored,
       rpc.statd  creates  a file in /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm.  When
       starting, it iterates through these files and notifies the
       peer rpc.statd on those machines.

OPTIONS
       -F     By  default, rpc.statd forks and puts itself in the
              background when started. The -F argument  tells  it
              to  remain in the foreground. This option is mainly
              for debugging purposes.

       -d     By default, rpc.statd sends  logging  messages  via
              syslog(3) to system log.  The -d argument forces it
              to log  verbose  output  to  stderr  instead.  This
              option  is  mainly  for debugging purposes, and may
              only be used in conjunction with the -F  parameter.

       -n, --name name
              specify  a  name  for rpc.statd to use as the local
              hostname. By default, rpc.statd will call  gethost­
              name(2)  to  get  the  local hostname. Specifying a
              local hostname may be useful for machines with more
              than one interfaces.

       -o, --outgoing-port port
              specify  a port for rpc.statd to send outgoing sta­
              tus requests from.  By default, rpc.statd will  ask
              portmap(8)  to assign it a port number.  As of this
              writing, there is not a standard port  number  that
              portmap  always  or  usually assigns.  Specifying a
              port may be useful when implementing a firewall.

       -p, --port port
              specify a port for  rpc.statd  to  listen  on.   By
              default, rpc.statd will ask portmap(8) to assign it
              a port number.  As of this writing, there is not  a
              standard port number that portmap always or usually
              assigns.  Specifying a  port  may  be  useful  when
              implementing a firewall.

       -?     Causes rpc.statd to print out command-line help and
              exit.

       -V     Causes rpc.statd to print out  version  information
              and exit.




TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT
       This  rpc.statd  version  is  protected by the tcp_wrapper
       library. You have to give the clients access to  rpc.statd
       if  they  should  be  allowed to use it. To allow connects
       from clients of the .bar.com domain you could use the fol­
       lowing line in /etc/hosts.allow:

       statd: .bar.com

       You  have to use the daemon name statd for the daemon name
       (even if the binary has a different name). For the  client
       names  you  can  only  use the keyword ALL or IP addresses
       (NOT host or domain names).

       For further information please have a look at the tcpd(8),
       hosts_allow(5) and hosts_access(5) manual pages.
