NAME
       losetup - set up and control loop devices

SYNOPSIS
       losetup [ -e encryption ] [options] loop_device file
       losetup [ -d ] loop_device

DESCRIPTION
       losetup  is  used  to  associate loop devices with regular
       files or block devices, to  detach  loop  devices  and  to
       query the status of a loop device. If only the loop_device
       argument is given, the status of  the  corresponding  loop
       device is shown.

OPTIONS
       -d     detach the file or device associated with the spec­
              ified loop device.

       -e encryption
              enable data encryption. The following keywords  are
              recognized:

              NONE   use no encryption (default).
              XOR    use a simple XOR encryption.
              AES128 use  128  bit  AES  encryption.  Password is
                     hashed with SHA-256.
              AES192 use 192  bit  AES  encryption.  Password  is
                     hashed with SHA-384.
              AES256 use  256  bit  AES  encryption.  Password is
                     hashed with SHA-512.
              AES    use AES encryption. Password is fed directly
                     to  AES  cipher.   Length  of  the  password
                     determines encryption key length.

       -o offset
              the data start is moved offset bytes into the spec­
              ified file or device.

       -p num read   the  passphrase  from  file  descriptor  num
              instead of the terminal.

       -S pseed
              sets  encryption  password  seed  pseed  which   is
              appended  to user supplied password before hashing.
              Using  different  seeds  for  different  partitions
              makes  dictionary  attacks slower but does not pre­
              vent them if user supplied password is guessable.

RETURN VALUE
       losetup returns 0 on success,  nonzero  on  failure.  When
       losetup displays the status of a loop device, it returns 1
       if the device is not configured and 2 if an error occurred
       which prevented losetup from determining the status of the
       device.


FILES
       /dev/loop0,/dev/loop1,...   loop devices (major=7)

EXAMPLE
       If you are using the loadable module  you  must  have  the
       module loaded first with the command

              # insmod loop.o

       The  following commands can be used as an example of using
       the loop device.

              dd if=/dev/zero of=/file bs=1k count=100
              losetup -e AES128 /dev/loop0 /file
              Password:
              mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0 100
              mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt
               ...
              umount /dev/loop0
              losetup -d /dev/loop0

       If you are using the loadable module you  may  remove  the
       module with the command

              # rmmod loop


RESTRICTION
       XOR encryption is terribly weak.
