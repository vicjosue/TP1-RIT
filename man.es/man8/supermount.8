NAME
       supermount - Enable or disable supermount feature

SYNOPSIS
       supermount [OPTION]... <disable | enable>

DESCRIPTION
       supermount  allows  system administrator to enable or dis­
       able the supermount feature  offered  in  recent  mandrake
       kernels.   This feature automatically manages mounting and
       unmounting removable medias when needed.  The script  sim­
       ply  adds  or remove the supermount option from within the
       entries of the /etc/fstab file.   Without  option  -i  the
       modified file is printed to stdout.

       supermount  has  to  be launched with one of the following
       arguments:

       enable in order to enable supermount feature  on  relevant
       drives
              (cdrom and floppy drives),

       disable in order to disable the supermount feature on all
              drives.

OPTIONS
       -f=FILE, --file=FILE Indicates an alternate file where
              to make modifications. The default is /etc/fstab.

       -m, --mountpoint Specify a specificall mountpoint to
              enable.

       -i, --infile Modifications are made directly to
              /etc/fstab or FILE  specified  through  -f  option,
              instead of being outputted to stdout.

       -h, --help, -? print a short help message.
