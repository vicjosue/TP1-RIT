NAME
       lpadmin - configure cups printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -h server ] -d destination
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -h server ] -p printer option(s)
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -h server ] -x destination

DESCRIPTION
       lpadmin  configures  printer  and class queues provided by
       CUPS. It can also  be  used  to  set  the  system  default
       printer or class.

       When  specified  before  the -d, -p, or -x options, the -E
       option forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       The first form of the command sets the default printer  or
       class to destination.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via
       the lp(1) or lpr(1) commands  will  use  this  destination
       unless the user specifies otherwise.

       The  second  form  of  the  command  configures  the named
       printer.  The additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command deletes the printer or class
       destination.   Any  jobs that are pending for the destina­
       tion will be removed and any job that is currently printed
       will be aborted.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The  following  options  are recognized when configuring a
       printer queue:

       -c class
            Adds the named printer to class.  If class  does  not
            exist it is created automatically.

       -i interface
            Sets  a  System  V  style  interface  script  for the
            printer.  This option cannot be specified with the -P
            option  (PPD file) and is intended for providing sup­
            port for legacy printer drivers.

       -m model
            Sets a standard System V interface script or PPD file
            from the model directory.

       -o name=value
            Sets  a  PPD  or  server  option for the printer. PPD
            options can be listed using the -l  option  with  the
            lpoptions(1) command.

       -o job-k-limit=value
            Sets  the  kilobyte  limit  for  per-user quotas. The
            value is an integer number of kilobytes; one kilobyte
            is 1024 bytes.

       -o job-page-limit=value
            Sets the page limit for per-user quotas. The value is
            the integer number of pages that can be printed; dou­
            ble-sided pages are counted as two pages.

       -o job-quota-period=value
            Sets  the  accounting period for per-user quotas. The
            value is an integer number of seconds; 86,400 seconds
            are in one day.

       -r class
            Removes the named printer from class.  If the result­
            ing class becomes empty it is removed.

       -u allow:user,user
            -u deny:user,user -u allow:all -u deny:none
            Sets user-level access control on a printer. The lat­
            ter two forms turn user-level access control off.

       -v device-uri
            Sets  the  device-uri attribute of the printer queue.
            If device-uri is a filename it is automatically  con­
            verted to the form file:/file/name.

       -D info
            Provides a textual description of the printer.

       -E
            Enables  the  printer  and  accepts jobs; this is the
            same as running the accept(8) and enable(8)  programs
            on the printer.

       -L location
            Provides a textual location of the printer.

       -P ppd-file
            Specifies  a  PostScript  Printer Description file to
            use with the printer. If specified, this option over­
            rides the -i option (interface script).

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the  System V printing system, CUPS allows printer
       names to contain any printable character except SPACE  and
       TAB. Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.
       Finally, the CUPS version of lpadmin may ask the user  for
       an  access  password depending on the printing system con­
       figuration.  This differs from the System V version  which
       requires the root user to execute this command.

LIMITATIONS
       The  CUPS  version  of lpadmin does not support all of the
       System V or Solaris printing system configuration options.
