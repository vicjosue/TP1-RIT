NAME
       apmd - Advanced Power Management (APM) daemon

SYNOPSIS
       apmd  [  -c  check_seconds  ]  [  -P proxy_cmd ] [ -p per­
       cent_to_log ] [ -qVvWg ] [ -w warn_percent ] [ -? ]  [dep­
       recated options]

DESCRIPTION
       apmd is an APM monitoring daemon, and works in conjunction
       with the APM BIOS driver in the OS kernel.  It can execute
       a  command  (normally  a shell script) when certain events
       are reported by the driver, and will log, via  syslogd(8),
       certain  changes  in system power status.  When the avail­
       able battery power becomes very  low,  it  can  alert  all
       users on the system using several methods.

       When  the kernel APM driver notifies the daemon of a pend­
       ing suspend or  standby  request,  apmd  will  invoke  the
       approprate  command,  log  the  event, sync(2) data to the
       disk, sleep briefly to help ensure all the  data  actually
       gets to the disk, and then tell the APM driver to continue
       its operation.  However, for "critical" suspends (indicat­
       ing an emergency shutdown) only the last step (telling the
       driver to continue) is performed.

       Most uses of this daemon will use  the  proxy  command  to
       support  power  conservation  activities.  This command is
       searched for by default in /etc/apmd_proxy and is  invoked
       with one or two arguments:

       start  Invoked when the daemon starts.  Normally sets sys­
              tem-wide power  policy,  such  as  IDE  hard  drive
              standby times, to account for whether battery power
              is in use.

       stop   Invoked when the daemon stops.  Normally undoes any
              policy settings done when the daemon started.

       suspend [ system | user ]
              Invoked  when  the  APM  driver reports that system
              suspension has been initiated.  The second  parame­
              ter  indicates  whether  the  BIOS or a user action
              (such as closing a laptop) initiated suspension.

              The  BIOS  "suspend"  mode  aggressively  conserves
              power,  and normally involves shutting off power to
              all devices except the CPU core and  memory,  which
              is kept in a very low power mode.  Most laptops can
              stay suspended, using battery power alone, for sev­
              eral  days.  ("Hibernation" is a kind of super-sus­
              pend, where all that state is written to  disk  and
              the machine uses even less power bcause it can turn
              off that CPU core, using no battery power  at  all.
              At  this  writing,  Linux does not support hiberna­
              tion.)  PCMCIA devices should be manually suspended
              using cardctl(8), and some modular drivers may need
              to be unloaded.

       standby [ system | user ]
              Invoked when the APM  driver  reports  that  system
              standby  has  been initiated.  The second parameter
              indicates whether the BIOS or a user  action  (such
              as invoking apm -s) caused this.

              The  BIOS  "standby" mode slightly conserves power,
              and leaves the machine able to respond almost imme­
              diately  to user activity.  Most laptops can't stay
              in standby mode for even a day, if they  must  rely
              on  battery  power.   Normally, nothing needs to be
              done beyond what the BIOS itself will do.

       resume [ suspend | standby | critical ]
              Invoked when the APM driver reports that system has
              resumed  normal  operation.   The  second parameter
              indicates what sort  of  mode  it  was  in  before,
              either  the  "suspend"  mode (possibly a "critical"
              suspend) or else "standby" mode.

              The system clock must be updated to match the hard­
              ware clock; this will normally have been handled by
              the kernel's APM driver.  PCMCIA devices  may  need
              to  be  manually  resumed  from standby using card­
              ctl(8), and some modular drivers  may  need  to  be
              reloaded  or  otherwise reinitialized.  In the case
              of a critical suspend, system state  may  not  have
              been completely saved due to an emergency shutdown;
              applications and and drivers may be in  a  confused
              state.

       change power
              This  presents  a  subset  of the APM driver "power
              change" events, specifically those where  AC  power
              was  added  or removed.  This will often modify the
              system wide power policy; for example, so that  IDE
              hard  drives  aggressively  enter standby mode when
              only battery power is available.

       change battery
              The APM driver has reported that  the  BIOS  thinks
              the  strength  of one (or more) batteries is "low";
              at least ten minutes of should power remain.

       change capability
              Some change in the power management capabilities of
              the  system  was reported.  It may have been caused
              by operation of  some  setup  utility,  or  by  the
              arrival or removal of some devices.

       This  daemon  issues  a  number of different log messages,
       most of which should be self  explanatory.   The  messages
       emitted for battery status need some explanation, however.
       The information logged contains 4 fields after a "Battery"
       or "Charge" label:

       1)  Rate  of  discharge  (percent/minute).  Negative rates
              indicate charging.

       2) Time since total charge or total discharge  (hh:mm:ss).
              This  value  is only useful if it reflects the time
              since a 100% or 0% state has been reached.   Other­
              wise, this time is in parentheses, and reflects the
              time since the last "important" apmd status  change
              such as starting the daemon, changing from AC power
              to battery power, and so on.

       3) Estimate of time left until total discharge  (or  total
              charge),  assuming  use  similar  to that since the
              last resume ( or since  AC  was  connected).   This
              time is calculated by apmd itself.

       4)  Parenthetically,  the  percent and length of remaining
              battery life, as estimated by the APM  BIOS  (which
              is  often  a conservative estimate from an intelli­
              gent battery itself).  This particular  information
              is provided with most messages from this daemon.

       This  daemon  supports APM BIOS 1.2 events, though it does
       not support some of the advanced features such as multiple
       batteries.   Also,  there  is no interaction yet with ACPI
       support as found in newer PC hardware.

OPTIONS
       -c seconds, --check seconds
              Controls  how  many  seconds  to   block   on   the
              /dev/apm_bios  device.   Normally the daemon blocks
              until the APM driver reports an event; this  number
              may be changed to cause battery charge or discharge
              rates to be checked more often.

       -P proxy_cmd, --apmd_proxy proxy_cmd
              Identifies the command to invoke when  certain  APM
              driver events are reported.  See above for informa­
              tion about the arguments to this script.

       -p percent_change, --percentage percent_change
              Every  time  the  percentage  of  available   power
              changes  (discharge or recharge) by percent_change,
              log information.  The default  is  5.   Use  values
              greater than 100 to disable this feature.

       -V, --version
              Print the daemon's version and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Enables  verbose mode, where each event reported by
              the APM driver is logged.

       -W, --wall
              In addition  to  logging  low  battery  status  (as
              determined  either  by  the  -w level or by the APM
              BIOS) using syslog(2), also use  wall(1)  to  alert
              all  users.   This  is most useful if syslogd(8) is
              not set up to write ALERT messages  to  all  users.
              If  both  methods  are  used, more warnings will be
              made during the critical time period.

       -w warn_percent, --warn warn_percent
              When the battery is not being charged and the  per­
              centage  of  available  power drops below warn_per­
              cent, log a warning at ALERT  level  to  syslog(2).
              If the -W or --wall flag was given, the daemon will
              also use wall(1) to alert all  users  of  impending
              doom.   Give  the  warning each time the percentage
              changes.  The default is 10.  Use  negative  values
              to disable this feature.

       -q, --quiet
              Disables  the  warnings identified by the -W and -w
              options.  (The APM BIOS on many machines will  pro­
              vide  an  audible warning when power is about to be
              used  up,  so  those  extra  warnings  may  not  be
              needed.)

       -g, --graphic_switch
              Enables  the  switch  to the first console when the
              current console  is  in  graphic  mode  on  suspend
              events and the switch back on resume events.

       -?, --help
              Prints a usage message and exits.

       New software should only use the proxy script, rather than
       the following now-deprecated options (most of  which  have
       never appeared in a production release).  If they are pro­
       vided, they take precedence over any proxy command invoca­
       tion for each event.

       -a ac_online_cmd, --ac_online ac_online_cmd
              Provides  a command to be run when AC power becomes
              available, though not when the daemon first starts.

       -b ac_offline_cmd, --ac_offline ac_offline_cmd
              Provides  a  command  to be run when the machine is
              operating on battery power,  though  not  when  the
              daemon first starts.

       -l low_battery_cmd, --low_battery low_battery_cmd
              Provides  a  command  to  be  run when the APM BIOS
              judges that battery power is "low".

       -s pre_suspend_cmd, --pre_suspend pre_suspend_cmd
              Provides a command  to  be  run  before  suspending
              through the driver.

       -r post_resume_cmd, --post_resume post_resume_cmd
              Provides a command to be run after resuming through
              the driver.

       -u, --utc
              (This option is now completely ignored.)  The  BIOS
              clock  is  set  to  UTC (GMT), so the daemon should
              pass the -u option to the clock or hwclock  program
              when  coming out of suspend or resume mode, or when
              responding to the BIOS update time event.

BUGS
       The first status report printed after a power  change  may
       be  inaccurate because the power change occured at a frac­
       tional percentage that was rounded to a  full  percentage.
       For  example, say you are discharging the machine and have
       50.9% power, which is reported as 50%.  When you start  to
       charge the machine, it will only have 0.1% left before the
       percentage flips to 51%, and the charge rate will be  dra­
       matically over-estimated.

       There  needs to be a more general hook to let other appli­
       cations participate in system power  management  decisions
       and policies.

       Multiple  batteries  are currently treated as if they were
       just one large one.
