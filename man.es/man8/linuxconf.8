NAME
       linuxconf - System configuration/administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       linuxconf [ --help ]
       linuxconf [ UI options ] [ options ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       linuxconf  is  a  sophisticated  administration  tool  for
       Linux.  It provides a complete framework  so  modules  can
       concentrate on the task to perform. The framework provides

       User interface independance.
       Fine grain privileges granting.
       Multiple modules co-working on the same dialog.
       Module providing generic interface to other modules.
       Extensive configurability (file path, command path).

       Linuxconf has also extensive command  line  options.  Each
       module may add its own set.


User interface options (UI options)
       linuxconf  supports 3 user interfaces: Text, graphical and
       WEB. The WEB interface is triggered by an http request  on
       port  98.  The other interfaces are selected based on con­
       text. But one may force linuxconf to pick on or the other.

       User  interface options must be presented before any other
       options on the command line.  The  following  options  are
       provided:


       --gui  forces  the graphical mode. In general, there is no
              point to force the graphical mode. It is  possible,
              using  the  feature  dialog found in Linuxconf main
              menu to disable the graphical mode (useful on  less
              capable machine). The --gui option override this.


       --guiproto
              is used to tell Linuxconf it is being called by its
              GUI front-end.  In  general,  Linuxconf  calls  the
              front-end  itself,  but it is sometime useful to do
              the reverse, especially when doing remote  adminis­
              tration.  For  example,  the following command pro­
              vides a very efficient and secure  remote  adminis­
              tration solution:

              remadmin --exec ssh some-host linuxconf --guiproto


       --mono force the monochrome color scheme in text mode.


       --silent
              disable  messages  printing  on the console in text
              mode.


       --text forces the text mode interface. Linuxconf is  built
              using   the  ncurses  library,  so  obey  the  TERM
              variable to handle screen drawing properly.


WEB interface
       By default, on most installation,  the  WEB  interface  is
       disabled.   When active, it provides access to pretty much
       every feature found in Linuxconf.

       The WEB interface is listening on TCP port  98.  Linuxconf
       does  not requires any WEB server. As such, it can config­
       ure even a non active Apache server for example. Linuxconf
       own WEB server is started from inetd or xinetd, on demand.
       See networking / misc / network access for more details.

       Linuxconf in WEB mode starts a single process. The process
       goes  away  after  10  minutes of inactivity (configurable
       from the features dialog in the main menu).


OPTIONS
       --archive file_path/sub-system ...
              copies some  configuration  files  to  the  archive
              (/etc/linuxconf/archive).  The  files  are recorded
              using RCS if available. The option expect a list of
              sub-systems and absolute file paths. For example:

              linuxconf --archive /etc/smb.conf
              linuxconf --archive netclient


       --demo This triggers a special http mode. Linuxconf does a
              change root to the  directory  /demo_linuxconf  and
              executes  from  there.  All system sensible updates
              are    stopped.    http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linux­
              conf/demo.html  has been running this live demo for
              several years now.

              See the script  install-demo.sh  to  build  a  demo
              directory.


       --diff file_path/sub-system ...
              produce  a  "diff"  output of various configuration
              files. It compares the current state with the  last
              archived version. Like --archive, it expects a list
              of sub-systems and file paths.


       --extract file_path/sub-system ...
              will replace the current version of some configura­
              tion  file  with  the  last version in the archive.
              Like --archive, the option expects a list  of  sub-
              systems and absolute file paths.


       --help presents the various command line options, for Lin­
              uxconf and all  components  and  modules.  This  is
              always presented in text mode.


       --helpfile
              presents the list of all help files known to Linux­
              conf (including all modules).  Lines starting  with
              *** indicate a missing (not written) help file.


       --hint is an option used by some service to help them per­
              form their task. This is never used directly by the
              system administrator.


       --history file_path/sub-system ...
              presents  the revision of the various configuration
              files. It is currently presenting the output of the
              rlog  command  (RCS  system).  It  expects the same
              extra parameters as --archive.


       --http triggers the WEB mode. When started from  inetd  or
              xinetd,  Linuxconf  used  the supplied socket. When
              started from the command line, Linuxconf  binds  to
              port 8000 (see the --port option below).


       --listconfig
              presents  all  configuration  files known to Linux­
              conf. Each file path is presented  with  a  set  of
              flags  and  the  sub-system  name owning it.  The 3
              informations are separated  by  tabs.  Consult  the
              control/control files and systems/all configuration
              files help  screen  for  the  definition  of  those
              flags.


       --md5sum file_path/sub-system ...
              produces the MD5 digest of configurations files and
              sub-systems.


       --modulemain modulename [ options ]
              triggers the main function/menu  of  a  module.  In
              general, using --modulemain will present the module
              main menu. For example, doing

              linuxconf --modulemain dnsconf

              bring the DNS configurator main menu. A  short  cut
              mechanism  exist.   For  a given module fooconf one
              may do the following:

              ls -s /bin/linuxconf /bin/fooconf


              and calling the fooconf command will be  equivalent
              to  using  the longer --modulemain syntax.  Several
              modules are installed using this  short  cut  nota­
              tion.  This  includes dnsconf, mailconf, vregistry,
              viewlog, modemconf, managerpm, and uucpconf.


       --services
              triggers the control service activity dialog.


       --setkeymap keymapfile
              records the keymap. This option  is  only  used  on
              distribution  lacking  a well defined configuration
              file to store this information.


       --setmod module
              enables      this      module       (found       in
              /usr/lib/linuxconf/module).  If  the  user has dis­
              abled this module using the dialog found in control
              /  control  files  and  systems / linuxconf modules
              this option has no effect.


       --shutdown
              triggers the shutdown dialog found in  the  control
              panel sub-menu.


       --status
              probes  the  system  and present the list of action
              needed to brings the system current with  its  con­
              figuration.  Linuxconf  does this probing everytime
              you quit from an interactive session. See  --update
              below.


       --selectprofile profile
              archive the current profile and extract the config­
              uration files of the new profile.  Only  the  files
              belonging   to   different  archiving  familty  are
              archived/extracted. See the help screen in  control
              / control files and systems / linuxconf profiles to
              get more information on this topic.

              A profile switch may be triggered at boot  time  by
              passing  the  option  PROFILE=profile  at  the LILO
              prompt. The boot time menu  (askrunlevel)  must  be
              installed though.


       --unsetmod module
              disables the module.


       --update
              executes  the various actions found by the --status
              option.


       --vdb  is  obsolete.  It  was  the  key  to  the   virtual
              database.  It is now replaced by the vregistry mod­
              ule.


       --version
              prints Linuxconf version and exits.


The treemenu interface
       Linuxconf has several user  interfaces  and  even  several
       ways to present its menus. Users usually pick the one they
       prefer. The default interface in most installation is  the
       tree  menu.  You  have a tree on the left side and dialogs
       are poping up on the right side.

       The presentation  is  done  by  a  special  module  called
       treemenu.   One may disable it either interactivly in con­
       trol/ control files and systems / linuxconf  modules.   or
       by executing the following command:

       linuxconf --unsetmod treemenu

       The  content  of  the  tree  menu  is built dynamically by
       inspecting all modules. They are run in a simulation mode,
       travelling  from  one menu to the other. This may take few
       seconds on  slower  systems.  When  Linuxconf  builds  its
       treemenu, a popup inform you. Linuxconf will redo its menu
       if something has changed:  A  module  has  been  added  or
       removed, linuxconf was upgraded, or the operation language
       has changed.

       The treemenu date is stored in the file  /var/state/linux­
       conf/treemenu.cache.   If  the  file is missing, linuxconf
       will redo it. The file also hold the  state  of  the  tree
       menu  from  one  session  to the other (it remembers which
       branches are open or collapsed).

       This dynamic way of building the tree menu has a drawback.
       To  build the menu, linuxconf has to walk every module. If
       a module has a flaw, it may very well fail, making  linux­
       conf unusable. While building its menu, linuxconf produces
       a file /var/run/treemenu.log. This file shows  which  menu
       option  was  processed  last. This may help diagnose which
       module is the problem. To fix  this  issue  (after  having
       send  a  bug  report  to  linuxconf mailing list), one may
       either  disable  the  offending  module  or  disable   the
       treemenu module as shown above.


FILES
       /etc/conf.linuxconf
              Linuxconf edits configuration files in place. There
              is no intermediate registry or database.  It  reads
              and update various configurations.  For some infor­
              mation, there is no standard place (or no place  at
              all)   to   store   it.  Linuxconf  saves  this  in
              /etc/conf.linuxconf.  This file has a  simple  text
              of the form:

              key.subkey value ...

              The file is splitted in numerous section identified
              like this

              [ section-name ]


       /etc/linuxconf/archive
              When linuxconf updates  a  configuration  file,  it
              archives   the   original   copy   in   /etc/linux­
              conf/archive.  This  is   done   by   the   utility
              /usr/lib/linuxconf/lib/cfgarchive   (changeable  by
              the admin, see control / control files and  systems
              / all commands and daemons).

              cfgarchive  uses  RCS to archive the file if avail­
              able. If not, it keeps  the  last  copy  only.   To
              understand the archiving mechanism, one should con­
              sult the help screen for control  /  control  files
              and systems / system profiles.


       /etc/linuxconf/control
              Yhis directory contains the linuxconf addons. These
              are control file used to start/stop/restart a given
              service.  Addons  can  be seen as a friendly way to
              add custom services to a host. For more information
              consult  control / control files and systems / lin­
              uxconf addons.
