NAME
       usbmodules  -  List  kernel driver modules available for a
       plugged in USB device

SYNOPSIS
       usbmodules [--device /proc/bus/bus/NNN/NNN] [--check modu­
       lename] [--help] [--mapfile pathname] [--version pathname]

DESCRIPTION
       usbmodules lists driver modules that may be able to manage
       interfaces  on  currently plugged in USB devices.  usbmod­
       ules may be used by /sbin/hotplug or  one  of  its  agents
       (normally  /etc/hotplug/usb.agent)  when  USB  devices are
       "hot plugged" into the system.  This can be  done  by  the
       following Bourne shell syntax:

                   for module in $(usbmodules --device $DEVICE) ;
              do

                        modprobe -s -k "$module"

                   done

       The DEVICE environment variable is passed from the  kernel
       to  /sbin/hotplug during USB hotplugging if the kernel was
       configured using usbdevfs.  usbmodules currently  requires
       usbdevfs to operate.

       When  a  USB  device is removed from the system, the Linux
       kernel will decrement a usage count on USB driver  module.
       If  this  count  drops to zero (i.e., there are no clients
       for the USB device driver), then the modprobe  -r  process
       that  is  normally  configured  to run from cron every few
       minutes will eventually remove the unneeded module.


OPTIONS
       --check modulename
              Instead of listing the relevant modules, just  exit
              with   code  0  (success)  if  the  given  module's
              exported  USB  ID  patterns  matches.    Otherwise,
              return  failure.  usbmodules emits no output either
              way.

       --device /proc/bus/usb/MMM/NNN
              Selects which device usbmodules will examine.   The
              argument is currently mandatory.

       --help, -h
              Print a help message

       --mapfile /etc/hotplug/usb.handmap
              Use  the  specified  file  instead of the /lib/mod­
              ules/.../modules.usbmap file corresponding  to  the
              running kernel.

       --version
              Identifies  the  version  of usbutils this tool was
              built with.

FILES
       /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/modules.usbmap
              This file is  automatically  generated  by  depmod,
              versions 2.4.2 and later, and is used by usbmodules
              to determine which modules correspond to which  USB
              ID's.

       /proc/bus/usb
              An  optional  interface  to USB devices provided by
              Linux kernels with versions of the 2.4 USB support.
              Contains  per-bus  subdirectories  with  per-device
              files (offering a usermode driver API  as  well  as
              access  to device and configuration descriptors), a
              devices file containing a list of all USB  devices,
              and a drivers file listing USB device drivers known
              to the USB subsystem.
