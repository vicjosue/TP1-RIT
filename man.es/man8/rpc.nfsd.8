rpc.nfsd(8)                                           rpc.nfsd(8)



NAME
       rpc.nfsd - NFS server process

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd [-p port] nproc

DESCRIPTION
       The rpc.nfsd program implements the user level part of the
       NFS service. The main  functionality  is  handled  by  the
       nfsd.o kernel module; the user space program merely starts
       the specified number of kernel threads.

       The rpc.mountd server provides an ancially service  needed
       to satisfy mount requests by NFS clients.

OPTIONS
       -p port
              specify  a  diferent  port  to  listen  on  for NFS
              requests. By default, rpc.nfsd will listen on  port
              2049.

       nproc  specify  the  number  of  NFS  server  threads.  By
              default, just one thread is started.  However,  for
              optimum performance several threads should be used.
              The actual figure depends on the number of and  the
              work  load created by the NFS clients, but a useful
              starting point is 8 threads. Effects  of  modifying
              that  number  can  be  checked using the nfsstat(8)
              program.
