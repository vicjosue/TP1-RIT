       vviissuuddoo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous
       to vipw(8).  vviissuuddoo locks the sudoers file against multi­
       ple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and
       checks for parse errors.  If the sudoers file is currently
       being edited you will receive a message to try again
       later.

       There is a hard-coded list of editors that vviissuuddoo will use
       set at compile-time that may be overridden via the editor
       sudoers Default variable.  This list defaults to the path
       to vi(1) on your system, as determined by the configure
       script.  Normally, vviissuuddoo does not honor the EDITOR or
       VISUAL environment variables unless they contain an editor
       in the aforementioned editors list.  However, if vviissuuddoo is
       configured with the --with-enveditor flag or the enveditor
       Default variable is set in sudoers, vviissuuddoo will use any
       the editor defines by EDITOR or VISUAL.  Note that this
       can be a security hole since it allows the user to execute
       any program they wish simply by setting EDITOR or VISUAL.

       vviissuuddoo parses the sudoers file after the edit and will not
       save the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding
       an error, vviissuuddoo will print a message stating the line
       number(s) where the error occurred and the user will
       receive the "What now?" prompt.  At this point the user
       may enter "e" to re-edit the sudoers file, "x" to exit
       without saving the changes, or "Q" to quit and save
       changes.  The "Q" option should be used with extreme care
       because if vviissuuddoo believes there to be a parse error, so
       will ssuuddoo and no one will be able to ssuuddoo again until the
       error is fixed.  If "e" is typed to edit the  sudoers file
       after a parse error has been detected, the cursor will be
       placed on the line where the error occurred (if the editor
       supports this feature).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       vviissuuddoo accepts the following command line options:

       -c  Enable cchheecckk--oonnllyy mode.  The existing sudoers file
           will be checked for syntax and a message will be
           printed to the standard output detailing the status of
           sudoers.  If the syntax check completes successfully,
           vviissuuddoo will exit with a value of 0.  If a syntax error
           is encountered, vviissuuddoo will exit with a value of 1.

       -f  Specify and alternate sudoers file location.  With
           this option vviissuuddoo will edit (or check) the sudoers
           file of your choice, instead of the default,
           @sysconfdir@/sudoers.  The lock file used is the spec­
           ified sudoers file with ".tmp" appended to it.

       -q  Enable qquuiieett mode.  In this mode details about syntax
           errors are not printed.  This option is only useful
           when combined with the --cc flag.


       -s  Enable ssttrriicctt checking of the sudoers file.  If an
           alias is used before it is defined, vviissuuddoo will con­
           sider this a parse error.  Note that it is not possi­
           ble to differentiate between an alias and a hostname
           or username that consists solely of uppercase letters,
           digits, and the underscore ('_') character.

       -V  The --VV (version) option causes vviissuuddoo to print its
           version number and exit.

EERRRROORRSS
       sudoers file busy, try again later.
           Someone else is currently editing the sudoers file.

       /etc/sudoers.tmp: Permission denied
           You didn't run vviissuuddoo as root.

           Your userid does not appear in the system passwd file.

       Warning: undeclared Alias referenced near ...
           Either you are using a {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias
           before defining it or you have a user or hostname
           listed that consists solely of uppercase letters, dig­
           its, and the underscore ('_') character.  If the lat­
           ter, you can ignore the warnings (ssuuddoo will not com­
           plain).  In --ss (strict) mode these are errors, not
           warnings.
