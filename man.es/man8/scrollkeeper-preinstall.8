NAME
       scrollkeeper-preinstall  -  generate on OMF file, based on
       an existing OMF file, which has the correct URL for a doc­
       ument

SYNOPSIS
       scrollkeeper-preinstall url input-omf-file output-omf-file

DESCRIPTION
       scrollkeeper-preinstall creates the OMF  file  output-omf-
       file by reading the given existing OMF file input-omf-file
       and replacing the URL for a resource  (typically  a  docu­
       ment)  with  the URL given by url.  This is typically done
       as part of the build process for an application, since the
       actual  location that a document is installed is not known
       until the application is built.

       If output-omf-file is specified with a path, and that path
       does not exist, the path is created.

       The url is typically the "file:" URI followed by the abso­
       lute path to a document which is (or will  be)  installed.
       (eg. "file:/usr/doc/scrollkeeper/scrollkeeper.sgml")
