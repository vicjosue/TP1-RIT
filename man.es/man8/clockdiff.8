CLOCKDIFF(8)             Iputils-ss990107            CLOCKDIFF(8)



NAME
       clockdiff - Measures clock difference between us and <des­
       tination> with 1msec resolution. Without -o option it uses
       icmp  timestamps, with -o it uses icmp echo with timestamp
       IP option.

SYNOPSIS
       clockdiff [-o|-o1] <destination>

WARNINGS
       * some nodes (f.e. Solaris<2.4) do not support icmp
              timestamps. clockdiff -o still works.

       * some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard timestamps,
              which makes clockdiff useless.

       * some nodes use wrong timestamps (Solaris>2.4), if
              run xntpd. Seems, it uses different  clock  source,
              which is synchronized to time-of-day clock periodi­
              cally.

       * -o1 uses three-node tstamp. What option (-o or -o1)
              works better depends on target host.
