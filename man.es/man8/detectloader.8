NAME
       detectloader - Detect what type of loader you have on your
       disk.

DESCRIPTION
       detectloader detects the type of the boot loader you  have
       on  your MBR. It finds the first disk via /proc/partitions
       and looks via the magic serial what kind  of  boot  loader
       you have installed.

LIMITATION
       Supports  only grub, lilo, and yaboot (the boot loaders we
       use for Linux Mandrake). Patches welcome  for  other  boot
       loaders.
