NAME
       smbmnt - helper utility for mounting SMB filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       smbmnt mount-point [ -s <share> ]  [ -r ]  [ -u <uid> ]  [
       -g <gid> ]  [ -f <mask> ]  [ -d <mask> ]  [ -o <options> ]

DESCRIPTION
       smbmnt  is  a helper application used by the smbmount pro­
       gram to do the actual mounting of SMB shares.  smbmnt  can
       be  installed  setuid  root if you want normal users to be
       able to mount their SMB shares.

       A setuid smbmnt will  only  allow  mounts  on  directories
       owned  by the user, and that the user has write permission
       on.

       The smbmnt program is normally invoked by smbmount(8)

       smbmount searches the normal PATH  for  smbmnt.  You  must
       ensure  that  the  smbmnt version in your path matches the
       smbmount used.

OPTIONS
       -r     mount the filesystem read-only

       -u uid specify the uid that the files will be owned by

       -g gid specify the gid that the files will be owned by

       -f mask
              specify the octal file mask applied

       -d mask
              specify the octal directory mask applied

       -o options
              list of options that are passed as-is to smbfs,  if
              this  command  is run on a 2.4 or higher Linux ker­
