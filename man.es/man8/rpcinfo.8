RPCINFO(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 RPCINFO(8)

NAME
     rpcinfo - report RPC information

SYNOPSIS
     rpcinfo -p [host]
     rpcinfo [-n portnum] -u host program [version]
     rpcinfo [-n portnum] -t host program [version]
     rpcinfo -b program version
     rpcinfo -d program version

DESCRIPTION
     rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.

OPTIONS
     -p      Probe the portmapper on host, and print a list of all registered
             RPC programs.  If host is not specified, it defaults to the value
             returned by hostname(1).

     -u      Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the specified host
             using UDP, and report whether a response was received.

     -t      Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the specified host
             using TCP, and report whether a response was received.

     -n      Use portnum as the port number for the -t and -u options instead
             of the port number given by the portmapper.

     -b      Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified program and
             version using UDP and report all hosts that respond.

     -d      Delete registration for the RPC service of the specified program
             and version.  This option can be exercised only by the super-
             user.

     The program argument can be either a name or a number.

     If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
     specified program.  Otherwise, rpcinfo attempts to find all the regis­
     tered version numbers for the specified program by calling version 0
     (which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to
     obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number
     instead) and attempts to call each registered version.  Note: the version
     number is required for -b and -d options.

EXAMPLES
     To show all of the RPC services registered on the local machine use:

           example% rpcinfo -p

     To show all of the RPC services registered on the machine named klaxon
     use:

           example% rpcinfo -p klaxon

     To show all machines on the local net that are running the Yellow Pages
     service use:

           example% rpcinfo -b ypserv 'version' | uniq

     where 'version' is the current Yellow Pages version obtained from the
     results of the -p switch above.

     To delete the registration for version 1 of the walld service use:

           example% rpcinfo -d walld 1

BUGS
     In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File System (NFS) did not
     register itself with the portmapper; rpcinfo cannot be used to make RPC
     calls to the NFS server on hosts running such releases.
