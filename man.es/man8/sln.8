SLN(8)              Linux Programmer's Manual              SLN(8)



NAME
       sln - static ln

SYNOPSIS
       sln source dest

DESCRIPTION
       sln  symbolically  links dest to source.  It is statically
       linked, needing no dynamic linking at all.   Thus  sln  is
       useful  to make symbolic links to dynamic libraries if the
       dynamic linking system for some reason is nonfunctional.

SEE ALSO
