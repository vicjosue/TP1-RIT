GROUPADD(8)                                           GROUPADD(8)



NAME
       groupadd - Create a new group

SYNOPSIS
       groupadd [-g gid [-o]] [-r] [-f] group

DESCRIPTION
       The groupadd command creates a new group account using the
       values specified on the command line and the default  val­
       ues  from  the system.  The new group will be entered into
       the system files as needed.  The options  which  apply  to
       the groupadd command are

       -g gid The  numerical value of the group's ID.  This value
              must be unique, unless the -o option is used.   The
              value  must be non-negative.  The default is to use
              the smallest ID value greater than 500 and  greater
              than  every  other group.  Values between 0 and 499
              are typically reserved for system accounts.

       -r     This  flag  instructs  groupadd  to  add  a  system
              account. First available gid lower than 499 will be
              automatically selected unless -g  option  is  given
              also on the command line.
              This is an option added by Red Hat Software.

       -f     This  is  force  flag. This will stop groupadd exit
              with error when the group about to be added already
              exists  on  the  system.  If  that is the case, the
              group won't be altered (or added  again,  for  that
              matter).
              This  option also modifies the way -g option works.
              When you request a gid that it is  not  unique  and
              you  don't  give  -o option too, the group creation
              will fall back to the standard behavior  (adding  a
              group  as neither -g or -o options were specified).
              This is an option added by Red Hat Software.
