NAME
       /usr/sbin/nscd - name service cache daemon

DESCRIPTION
       Nscd is a daemon that provides a cache for the most common
       name service requests.  The  default  configuration  file,
       /etc/nscd.conf,  determines the behavior of the cache dae­
       mon. See nscd.conf(5).

       Nscd provides cacheing for the  passwd(5),  group(5),  and
       hosts(5)  databases through standard libc interfaces, such
       as  getpwnam(3),  getpwuid(3),  getgrnam(3),  getgrgid(3),
       gethostbyname(3),  and  others.  Each cache has a separate
       TTL (time-to-live)  for  its  data;  modifying  the  local
       database  (/etc/passwd,  and so forth) causes the cache to
       become invalidated within fifteen seconds. Note  that  the
       shadow file is specifically not cached.  getspnam(3) calls
       remain uncached as a result.


OPTIONS
       --help will give you a list with all options and what they
              do.


NOTES
       Nscd doesn't know anything about the underlaying protocols
       for a  service.  This  also  means,  that  if  you  change
       /etc/resolv.conf  for  DNS  queries, nscd will continue to
       use the old one if you have configured  /etc/nsswitch.conf
       to  use  DNS for host lookups. In such a case, you need to
       restart nscd.
