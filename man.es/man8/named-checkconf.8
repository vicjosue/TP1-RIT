       tool

SYNOPSIS
       named-checkconf [ -v ]  [ -t directory ]  filename

       of a named configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -t directory
              chroot  to  directory so that include directives in
              the configuration file are processed as if run by a
              similarly chrooted named.

       -v     Print  the  version  of the named-checkconf program
              and exit.

       filename
              The name of the configuration file to  be  checked.
              If not specified, it defaults to /etc/named.conf.
