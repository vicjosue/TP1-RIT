NAME
       urpmi - rpm wrapper making installs easier for the user

SYNOPSIS
       urpmi [options] [package_names | rpm_files...]

DESCRIPTION
       urpmi  authorizes  well-known  rpms  (or  rpm files) to be
       installed including all their dependencies.  You  can  use
       it  to install source package dependencies too as root, or
       source package itself as simple user.

       You can compare rpm vs. urpmi  with  insmod  vs.  modprobe
       or dpkg vs apt-get

       Just  launch  urpmi followed by what you think is the name
       of the package(s), and urpmi will:
       - Propose different package names if availables and  quit.
       -  If  only  one  corresponding  package  is  found, check
       whether dependencies are already installed, or not.
       - If not, propose to install  the  dependencies  and  then
       install all required dependencies and the package.

       Note  that  urpmi handle installations from various medias
       (ftp, http, local and nfs volumes, removable  medias  such
       as  CDROMs)  and  is  able  to install dependencies from a
       media different from the package's media.   If  necessary,
       urpmi asks you to insert the required media.

       To add a new media containing rpms run urpmi.addmedia.
       To remove a media use urpmi.removemedia.
       To  update  the  packages  list  (for example when the ftp
       archive changed) use urpmi.update.
       To automatically install a  package  corresponding  to  an
       executable you tried to launch, use autoirpm.
       To  install  all available menu entries of all known pack­
       ages, use autoirpm-icons.

OPTIONS
       --help print an help message and exit (this is the same as
              -h or -?).

       --update
              use only update media. This means urpmi will search
              and resolve dependencies only in  media  marked  as
              update.

       --media
              select  specific  media to use instead of all media
              available (or update media is --updtae is used).

       --auto installs all required dependencies without  asking.

       --auto-select
              automatically  select  all packages that have to be
              upgraded according to  already  installed  packages
              and packages listed in various media registered.

       --fuzzy
              disable  fast  search  on exact package name, ie it
              will propose all package containing the  name  even
              if one has the given name (this is the same as -y).

       --src  next package name is a source package and  it  will
              select  all dependencies if urpmi is run as root or
              only install source package as simple user (this is
              the same as -s).

       --noclean
              do   not   remove   any   package  from  the  cache
              (/var/cache/urpmi/rpms).

       --complete
              use parsehdlist server  to  complete  --auto-select
              selection  (should not be necessary in most cases).

       --force
              assumes yes on all questions.

       --wget use wget only for  downloading  distant  files.  By
              default  curl is used if available or wget instead.

       --curl use curl only for  downloading  distant  files.  By
              default  curl is used if available or wget instead.

       --X    use X interface.

       --best-output
              try to use X interface  or  if  not  available  the
              standard text interface (using rpm).

       -a     if  multiple  packages  match  the substring given,
              take them all

       -p     allow search in provides to find package (default).

       -P     do  not search in provides to find package (this is
              the opposite of -p).

       -y     this is the same as --fuzzy.

       -s     this is the same as --src.

       -q     proposes a quiet mode when  calling  rpm  where  no
              upgrade status are printed.

       -v     proposes a verbose mode with various messages.
