NAME
       quotacheck  -  scan  a  filesystem for disk usage, create,
       check and repair quota files

SYNOPSIS
       quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [  -F  quota-format  ]  -a  |
       filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       quotacheck  examines  each  filesystem,  builds a table of
       current disk usage, and compares this table  against  that
       recorded  in  the disk quota file for the filesystem (this
       step is ommitted if  option  -c  is  specified).   If  any
       inconsistencies  are detected, both the quota file and the
       current system copy of the incorrect  quotas  are  updated
       (the  latter  only  occurs  if  an  active  filesystem  is
       checked).  By default, only user quotas are checked.  quo­
       tacheck  expects  each  filesystem  to  be checked to have
       quota files named [a]quota.user and [a]quota.group located
       at  the  root  of the associated filesystem.  If a file is
       not present, quotacheck will create it.

       If the quota file is corrupted, quotacheck tries  to  save
       as  much  data  as  possible.  Rescuing data may need user
       intervention. With no additional options  quotacheck  will
       simply  exit in such a situation. When in interactive mode
       (option -i) , the user is asked  for  advice.  Advice  can
       also be provided from command line (see option -n) , which
       is useful when quotacheck is run automatically  (ie.  from
       script) and failure is unacceptable.

       quotacheck  should  be  run each time the system boots and
       mounts non-valid filesystems.  This is most likely to hap­
       pen after a system crash.

       It  is  strongly recommended to run quotacheck with quotas
       turned off on for the filesystem. Otherwise, possible dam­
       age  or loss to data in the quota files can result.  It is
       also unwise to run quotacheck  on  a  live  filesystem  as
       actual usage may change during the scan.  To prevent this,
       quotacheck  tries  to  remount  the  filesystem  read-only
       before  starting  the  scan.   After  the  scan is done it
       remounts the filesystem read-write. You can  disable  this
       with  option  -m.  You can also make quotacheck ignore the
       failure to remount the filesystem  read-only  with  option
       -M.

OPTIONS
       -b     Forces quotacheck to make backups of the quota file
              before writing the new data.

       -v     quotacheck reports its operation as it  progresses.
              Normally it operates silently.

       -d     Enable  debugging mode.  It will result in a lot of
              information which can be used in debugging the pro­
              gram.  The output is very verbose and the scan will
              be slow.

       -u     Only user quotas listed  in  /etc/mtab  or  on  the
              filesystems  specified  are to be checked.  This is
              the default action.

       -g     Only group quotas listed in  /etc/mtab  or  on  the
              filesystems specified are to be checked.

       -c     Don't read existing quota files. Just perform a new
              scan and save it to disk.

       -f     Forces checking of filesystems with quotas enabled.
              This  is not recommended as the created quota files
              may be out of sync.

       -M     This flag forces checking of  filesystem  in  read-
              write  mode  if  a remount fails. Do this only when
              you are sure no process will write to a  filesystem
              while scanning.

       -m     Don't try to remount filesystem read-only. See com­
              ment with option -M.

       -i     Interactive mode. By default quotacheck exits  when
              it  finds  an  error.  In  interactive mode user is
              asked for input instead.  See option -n.

       -n     If the quota files become corrupted, it is possible
              for duplicate entries for a single user or group ID
              to exist.  Normally in this case, quotacheck  exits
              or  asks  user  for input. When this option is set,
              the first entry found is always used  (this  option
              works in interactive mode too).

       -F format-name
              Check  quota  quota for specified format (ie. don't
              perform format auto-detection). This is recommended
              as detection might not work well on corrupted quota
              files.  Possible format names are: vfsold  (version
              1  quota), vfsv0 (version 2 quota), rpc (quota over
              NFS), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -a     Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab

       -R     When used together with the -a option, all filesys­
              tems except for the root filesystem are checked for
              quotas.


NOTE
       quotacheck should only be run  by  super-user.  Non-privi­
       leged  users  are  presumably  not allowed to read all the
       directories on the given filesystem.
