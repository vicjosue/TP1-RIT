NAME
       cupsd - common unix printing system daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cupsd [ -c config-file ] [ -f ]

DESCRIPTION
       cupsd  is  the scheduler for the Common UNIX Printing Sys­
       tem. It implements a printing system based upon the Inter­
       net  Printing  Protocol,  version  1.1.  If no options are
       specified on the command-line then the default  configura­
       tion file (usually /etc/cups/cupsd.conf) will be used.

       The  -f  option forces cupsd to run in the foreground; the
       default is to run in the background as a "daemon".

COMPATIBILITY
       cupsd implements all of the  required  IPP/1.1  attributes
       and  operations.  It also implements several CUPS-specific
       administation operations.
