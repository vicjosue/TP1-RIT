DESCRIPTION
       ab  is  a  tool  for  benchmarking the performance of your
       Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.  It does
       this  by giving you an indication of how many requests per
       second your Apache installation can serve.


OPTIONS
       -k          Enable the HTTP KeepAlive  feature;  that  is,
                   perform multiple requests within one HTTP ses­
                   sion. Default is no KeepAlive.

       -d          Do not display the "percentage  served  within
                   XX [ms] table". (legacy support).

       -S          Do  not display the median and standard devia­
                   tion values,  nor  display  the  warning/error
                   messages  when the average and median are more
                   than one or two times the  standard  deviation
                   apart.  And default to the min/avg/max values.
                   (legacy support).

       -s          When compiled in (bb -h will show you) use the
                   SSL  protected https rather than the http pro­
                   tocol. This feature is experimental  and  very
                   rudimentary.  You  propably do not want to use
                   it.

       -k          Enable the HTTP KeepAlive  feature;  that  is,
                   perform multiple requests within one HTTP ses­
                   sion. Default is no KeepAlive.  -i Use an HTTP
                   'HEAD'  instead  of  the GET method. Cannot be
                   mixed with POST.

       -n requests The number of  requests  to  perform  for  the
                   benchmarking  session.  The default is to per­
                   form just one single request, which  will  not
                   give representative benchmarking results.

       -t timelimit
                   The  number  of seconds to spend benchmarking.
                   Using this option automatically set the number
                   of  requests  for  the benchmarking session to
                   50000.  Use this to benchmark the server for a
                   fixed period of time.  By default, there is no
                   timelimit.

       -c concurrency
                   The number of simultaneous  requests  to  per­
                   form.  The  default  is  to  perform  one HTTP
                   request at at time, that is, no concurrency.


       -p POST file
                   A file containing data that the  program  will
                   send  to  the  Apache  server in any HTTP POST
                   requests.


       -A Authorization username:password
                   Supply Basic Authentication credentials to the
                   server.  The  username  and password are sepa­
                   rated by a single ':', and sent  as  uuencoded
                   data.    The  string  is  sent  regardless  of
                   whether the server needs it; that is, has sent
                   a 401 Authentication needed.


       -X proxy[:port]
                   Route  all  requests  through  the  proxy  (at
                   optional port).


       -P Proxy-Authorization username:password
                   Supply Basic Authentication credentials  to  a
                   proxy  en-route. The username and password are
                   separated by a single ':', and sent  as  uuen­
                   coded  data.  The string is sent regardless of
                   whether the proxy needs it; that is, has  sent
                   a 407 Proxy authentication needed.


       -C Cookie name=value
                   Add a 'Cookie:' line to the request. The argu­
                   ment is typically a  'name=value'  pair.  This
                   option may be repeated.


       -p Header string
                   Append extra headers to the request. The argu­
                   ment is typically  in  the  form  of  a  valid
                   header  line,  usually a colon separated field
                   value  pair,  for  example,  'Accept-Encoding:
                   zip/zop;8bit'.


       -T content-type
                   The  content-type header to use for POST data.


       -g gnuplot file
                   Write all measured values out as  a  'gnuplot'
                   or  TSV  (Tab separate values) file. This file
                   can easily be imported into packages like Gnu­
                   plot,  IDL,  Mathematica, Igor or even Excell.
                   The labels are on the first line of the  file.


       -q          When processing more than 150 requsts; ab out­
                   puts a progress count on stderr every  10%  or
                   100  requests or so. The -q flag qill suppress
                   these messages.


       -e CSV file Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file which
                   contains for each percentage (from 1% to 100%)
                   the time (in milli seconds) it took  to  serve
                   that  percentage of the requests. This is usu­
                   ally more usefull than the 'gnuplot' file;  as
                   the results are already


       -v          Sets  the  verbosity level.  Level 4 and above
                   prints information on  headers,  level  3  and
                   above prints response codes (for example, 404,
                   200), and level 2 and  above  prints  warnings
                   and informational messages.


       -w          Print out results in HTML tables.  The default
                   table is two columns wide, with a white  back­
                   ground.

       -x attributes
                   The  string  to use as attributes for <table>.
                   Attributes are inserted <table here >

       -y attributes
                   The string to use as attributes for <tr>.

       -z attributes
                   The string to use as attributes for <td>.

       -V          Display the version number and exit.

       -h          Display usage information.

BUGS
       There are various statically  declared  buffers  of  fixed
       length.  Combined  with inefficient parsing of the command
       line arguments, the response headers from the server,  and
       other external inputs, these buffers might overflow.

       Ab  does  not  implement  HTTP/1.x fully; instead, it only
       accepts some 'expected' forms of responses.

       The rather heavy use of strstr(3) by the program may  skew
       performance   results,   since  it  uses  significant  CPU
       resources.  Make sure that performance limits are not  hit
       by ab before your server's limit is reached.

       The HTML output is not as complete as the text output.

       Up  to version 1.3d ab has propably reported values way to
       low for most measurements; as a single timeout  (which  is
       usually  in the order of seconds) will shift several thou­
       sands of milli-second responses by a considerable  factor.
       This  was  further componded by a serious interger overrun
       which would for realistic run's (i.e. those longer than  a
       few minutes) produce believable but totally bogus results.
       Thanks to Sander Temme <sctemme@covalent.net> for  solving
       this riddle.
