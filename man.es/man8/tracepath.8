TRACEPATH(8)        Linux Programmer's Manual        TRACEPATH(8)



NAME
       tracepath  -  traces path to <destination> discovering MTU
       along this path

SYNOPSIS
       tracepath destination [ port ]

DESCRIPTION
       It traces path to <destination> discovering MTU along this
       path.  It uses UDP port <port> or some random port.

       tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6
              and  classic  example  of  application  Linux error
              queues.  tracepath is worse, because commercial  IP
              routers  do  not  return enough information in icmp
              error messages.  Probably,  it  will  change,  when
              they  will  be updated.  For now it uses Van Jacob­
              son's trick, sweaping a range of UDP ports to main­
              tain trace history.  using source address <source>.

WARNING
       GENERAL NOTE: all these applets, except  for  tracepath[6]
       should  be excecutabel only with CAP_NET_RAWIO capability.
       To all that I know, they are safe to  be  used  as  setuid
       root.
