pam_localuser(8)  System Administrator's Manual  pam_localuser(8)



NAME
       pam_localuser - require users to be listed in /etc/passwd


SYNOPSIS
       account sufficient /lib/security/pam_localuser.so args
       account required /lib/security/pam_wheel.so group=devel


DESCRIPTION
       pam_localuser.so  exists to help implement site-wide login
       policies, where they typically include  a  subset  of  the
       network's  users  and  a  few accounts that are local to a
       particular  workstation.    Using   pam_localuser.so   and
       pam_wheel.so  or  pam_listfile.so  is  an effective way to
       restrict access to either local users and/or a  subset  of
       the network's users.

       This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a
       very short awk script invoked by  cron,  but  it's  common
       enough to have been separated out.
