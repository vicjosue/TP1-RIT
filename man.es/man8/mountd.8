rpc.mountd(8)                                       rpc.mountd(8)



NAME
       rpc.mountd - NFS mount daemon

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  rpc.mountd program implements the NFS mount protocol.
       When receiving a MOUNT request  from  an  NFS  client,  it
       checks  the request against the list of currently exported
       file systems. If the client is permitted to mount the file
       system,  rpc.mountd  obtains  a  file handle for requested
       directory and returns it to the client.

   Exporting NFS File Systems
       Making file systems available to  NFS  clients  is  called
       exporting.

       Usually,  a  file  system  and the hosts it should be made
       available to are listed  in  the  /etc/exports  file,  and
       invoking  exportfs  -a  whenever the system is booted. The
       exportfs(8) command makes export information available  to
       both  the kernel NFS server module and the rpc.mountd dae­
       mon.

       Alternatively, you can export individual directories  tem­
       porarily using exportfs's host:/directory syntax.

   The rmtab File
       For  every  mount  request  received  from  an NFS client,
       rpc.mountd adds an entry to the /var/state/nfs/rmtab file.
       When  receiving an unmount request, that entry is removed.
       user level part of the NFS service.

       However, this file is mostly ornamental. One,  the  client
       can  continue  to  use  the file handle even after calling
       rpc.mountd 's UMOUNT  procedure.  And  two,  if  a  client
       reboots  without notifying rpc.mountd , a stale entry will
       remain in rmtab.

OPTIONS
       -d kind  or  --debug kind
              Turn on debugging for kind.

       -F  or  --foreground
              Run in foreground (do not daemonize)

       -f  or  --exports-file
              This option specifies the exports file, listing the
              clients  that  this server is prepared to serve and
              parameters  to  apply  to  each  such  mount   (see
              exports(5)).   By  default,  export  information is
              read from /etc/exports.

       -h  or  --help
              Display usage message.

       -o num  or  --descriptors num
              Set the limit of the number of open  file  descrip­
              tors to num. The default is 256.

       -N  or  --no-nfs-version
              This  option can be used to request that rpc.mountd
              do not offer certain versions of NFS.  The  current
              version  of rpc.mountd can support both NFS version
              2 and the newer version 3. If the NFS kernel module
              was  compiled without support for NFSv3, rpc.mountd
              must be invoked with the option --no-nfs-version  3
              .

       -n  or  --no-tcp
              Don't advertise TCP for mount.

       -P     Ignored (compatibility with unfsd??).

       -p  or  --port
              Force  rpc.mountd  to  bind  to the specified port,
              instead of using the random port number assigned by
              the portmapper.

       -V  or  --nfs-version
              This  option can be used to request that rpc.mountd
              offer certain versions of NFS. The current  version
              of  rpc.mountd  can  support both NFS version 2 and
              the newer version 3.

       -v  or  --version
              Print the version of rpc.mountd and exit.


TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT
       This rpc.mountd version is protected  by  the  tcp_wrapper
       library. You have to give the clients access to rpc.mountd
       if they should be allowed to use  it.  To  allow  connects
       from clients of the .bar.com domain you could use the fol­
       lowing line in /etc/hosts.allow:

       mountd: .bar.com

       You have to use the daemon name mountd for the daemon name
       (even  if the binary has a different name). For the client
       names you can only use the keyword  ALL  or  IP  addresses
       (NOT host or domain names).

       For further information please have a look at the tcpd(8),
       hosts_allow(5) and hosts_access(5) manual pages.
