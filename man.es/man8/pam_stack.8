pam_stack(8)      System Administrator's Manual      pam_stack(8)



NAME
       pam_stack - recurse into other PAM stacks

SYNOPSIS
       auth required /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=foo
       session optional /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=foo
       password optional /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=foo
       account optional /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=foo

DESCRIPTION
       In  a  nutshell, pam_stack lets you "call", from inside of
       the stack for a particular service, the stack defined  for
       any  another  service.  The intention is to allow multiple
       services to "include" a system-wide setup,  so  that  when
       that setup needs to be changed, it need only be changed in
       one place.


ARGUMENTS
       debug  turns on debugging via syslog(3).

       service=name
              tells pam_stack.so to execute the stack defined for
              the  service  name,  which  will usually be another
              file in /etc/pam.d.


EXAMPLE
       /etc/pam.d/imap:
       auth required  /lib/security/pam_stack.so  service=system-
       auth
       auth required /lib/security/pam_shells.so
       /etc/pam.d/system-auth:
       auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_krb5.so
       auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so shadow nullok
       auth required /lib/security/pam_deny.so


CAVEAT
       Because  recursion  is fully supported, there is potential
       to really break things  by  having  a  stack  call  itself
       either directly or via mutual recursion.

BUGS
       Let's  hope  not,  but  if  you find any, please email the
       author.
