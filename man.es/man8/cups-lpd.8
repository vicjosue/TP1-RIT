NAME
       cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to
       lpd clients

SYNOPSIS
       cups-lpd [ -o option=value ]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-lpd is the CUPS Line  Printer  Daemon  ("LPD")  mini-
       server  that  supports  legacy client systems that use the
       LPD protocol.  cups-lpd does not act as a standalone  net­
       work  daemon  but  instead  operates  using  the  Internet
       "super-server" inetd(8). Add the  following  line  to  the
       inetd.conf file to enable the cups-lpd daemon:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd

       If  you are using the newer xinetd(8) daemon, add the fol­
       lowing lines to the xinetd.conf file:

           service printer
           {
               socket_type = stream
               protocol = tcp
               wait = no
               user = lp
               server = /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd
           }

OPTIONS
       The -o option to cups-lpd inserts options  for  all  print
       queues.  Most often this is used to disable the "l" filter
       so that remote print  jobs  are  filtered  as  needed  for
       printing:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd         -o document-format=application/octet-stream

       The  example shown resets the document format to be appli­
       cation/octet-stream, which forces  auto-detection  of  the
       print file type.

COMPATIBILITY
       cups-lpd  does not enforce the restricted source port num­
       ber specified in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports  does
       not  prevent  determined users from submitting print jobs.
       While this behavior is different  than  standard  Berkeley
       LPD  implementations,  it  should not affect normal client
       operations.

       The output of the status requests follows RFC  2569,  Map­
       ping  between LPD and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD imple­
       mentations  stray  from  this  definition,  remote  status
       reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.
