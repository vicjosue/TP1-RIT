DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-keygen generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure  DNS),  as
       defined  in  RFC  2535.  It can also generate keys for use
       with TSIG (Transaction  Signatures),  as  defined  in  RFC
       2845.

OPTIONS
       -a algorithm
              Selects  the  cryptographic algorithm. The value of
              algorithm must be one of RSAMD5  or  RSA,  DSA,  DH
              (Diffie  Hellman),  or  HMAC-MD5.  These values are
              case insensitive.

              Note that for DNSSEC, DSA is a mandatory to  imple­
              ment  algorithm,  and RSA is recommended. For TSIG,
              HMAC-MD5 is mandatory.

       -b keysize
              Specifies the number of bits in the key. The choice
              of key size depends on the algorithm used. RSA keys
              must be between 512 and 2048 bits.  Diffie  Hellman
              keys  must  be  between 128 and 4096 bits. DSA keys
              must be between 512 and 1024 bits and an exact mul­
              tiple  of  64.  HMAC-MD5 keys must be between 1 and
              512 bits.

       -n nametype
              Specifies the owner type of the key. The  value  of
              nametype  must  either  be  ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone
              key), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated  with  a
              host),  or USER (for a key associated with a user).
              These values are case insensitive.

       -c class
              Indicates that the DNS record  containing  the  key
              should  have the specified class. If not specified,
              class IN is used.

       -e     If generating an RSA key, use a large exponent.

       -g generator
              If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use this gener­
              ator.   Allowed values are 2 and 5. If no generator
              is specified, a known prime from RFC 2539  will  be
              used if possible; otherwise the default is 2.

       -h     Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
              to dnssec-keygen.

       -p protocol
              Sets the protocol value for the generated key.  The
              protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default
              is 2 (email) for keys of type USER and  3  (DNSSEC)
              for all other key types.  Other possible values for
              this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and  its  suc­
              cessors.

       -r randomdev
              Specifies  the source of randomness. If the operat­
              ing system does not provide a /dev/random or equiv­
              alent  device,  the default source of randomness is
              keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name  of  a
              character  device or file containing random data to
              be used instead of the default. The  special  value
              keyboard  indicates  that  keyboard input should be
              used.

       -s strength
              Specifies  the  strength  value  of  the  key.  The
              strength  is  a  number  between 0 and 15, and cur­
              rently has no defined purpose in DNSSEC.

       -t type
              Indicates the use of the key. type must be  one  of
              AUTHCONF,   NOAUTHCONF,   NOAUTH,  or  NOCONF.  The
              default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability  to
              authenticate  data, and CONF the ability to encrypt
              data.

       -v level
              Sets the debugging level.

GENERATED KEYS
       When dnssec-keygen completes  successfully,  it  prints  a
       string  of  the form Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard out­
       put. This is an identification string for the key  it  has
       generated.  These  strings  can  be  used  as arguments to
       dnssec-makekeyset.

       · nnnn is the key name.

       · aaa is the numeric representation of the algorithm.

       · iiiii is the key identifier (or footprint).

       dnssec-keygen creates two file, with names  based  on  the
       printed  string.  Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the public
       key, and  Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private  contains  the  private
       key.


       The  .key  file  contains  a  DNS  KEY  record that can be
       inserted into a zone file (directly  or  with  a  $INCLUDE
       statement).


       The  .private file contains algorithm specific fields. For
       obvious security reasons, this file does not have  general
       read permission.


       Both  .key  and .private files are generated for symmetric
       encryption algorithm such as  HMAC-MD5,  even  though  the
       public and private key are equivalent.


EXAMPLE
       To  generate a 768-bit DSA key for the domain example.com,
       the following command would be issued:

       dnssec-keygen -a DSA -b 768 -n ZONE example.com

       The command would print a string of the form:

       Kexample.com.+003+26160

       In this example, dnssec-keygen creates  the  files  Kexam­
       ple.com.+003+26160.key and Kexample.com.+003+26160.private
