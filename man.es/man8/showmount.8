SHOWMOUNT(8)                                         SHOWMOUNT(8)



NAME
       showmount - show mount information for an NFS server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/showmount [ -adehv ] [ --all ] [ --directories ]
       [ --exports ] [ --help ] [ --version ] [ host ]

DESCRIPTION
       showmount queries the mount daemon on a  remote  host  for
       information  about  the  state  of  the NFS server on that
       machine.  With no  options  showmount  lists  the  set  of
       clients  who are mounting from that host.  The output from
       showmount is designed to appear as though it were process­
       esed through ``sort -u''.

OPTIONS
       -a or --all
              List both the client hostname and mounted directory
              in host:dir format.

       -d or --directories
              List only the directories mounted by some client.

       -e or --exports
              Show the NFS server's export list.

       -h or --help
              Provide a short help summary.

       -v or --version
              Report the current version number of the program.

       --no-headers
              Suppress the descriptive headings from the  output.

BUGS
       The  completeness  and  accurary  of  the information that
       showmount displays varies according to  the  NFS  server's
       implementation.

       Because showmount sorts and uniqs the output, it is impos­
       sible to determine from the output  whether  a  client  is
       mounting the same directory more than once.
