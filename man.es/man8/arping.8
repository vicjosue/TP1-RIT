NAME
       arping - Ping <address> on device <interface> by ARP pack­
       ets, using source address <source>.

SYNOPSIS
       arping [ -D ] [ -U ] [ -A ] [ -c count ] [ -w timeout ]  [
       -q ] [ -s source ] -I interface address

DESCRIPTION
       Ping <address> on device <interface> by ARP packets, using
       source address <source>.

OPTIONS
       -c count
              number of pings.

       -w timeout
              stop after this time.

       -q     do not print any messages.

       -D     duplicate address detection mode.   Returns  0,  if
              DAD suceeded i.e. no replies are received.

       -U     Unsolicited  ARP  mode  to  update  neighbours' ARP
              caches.

       -A     The same as -U , but ARP REPLY packets used instead
              of ARP REQUEST.

       If -s option is absent, source address is:
              1.  In  normal mode calculated from routing tables.
              2.  In  DAD  (-D)  mode  set  to  0.0.0.0   3.   In
              Unsilicited ARP mode (-U,-A) set to <address>

WARNING
       GENERAL  NOTE:  all these applets, except for tracepath[6]
       should be excecutabel only with CAP_NET_RAWIO  capability.
       To  all  that  I  know, they are safe to be used as setuid
       root.
