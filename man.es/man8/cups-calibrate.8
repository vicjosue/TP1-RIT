       cups-calibrate - ESP Printer Calibration Tool

SYNOPSIS
       cups-calibrate

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  allows you to calibrate the color output of
       printers using  the  GIMP-PRINT  CUPS  or  ESP  Print  Pro
       drivers.

       Please  note  that  this program only works with the GIMP-
       PRINT CUPS or ESP Print Pro drivers. If you are using  the
       GIMP-Print stp driver of GhostScript or the drivers of the
       GIMP-Print plug-in of  GIMP,  this  calibration  will  not
       work.

       These  drivers by the text "CUPS+GIMP-print" or "ESP Print
       Pro" in the model description displayed by  the  CUPS  web
       interface,  KUPS,  the  ESP  Print Pro Printer Manager, or
       printerdrake.

       To make a calibration profile for all users, run this pro­
       gram as the "root" user.
