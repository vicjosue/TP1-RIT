MKINITRD(8)                                           MKINITRD(8)



NAME
       mkinitrd  -  creates initial ramdisk images for preloading
       modules

SYNOPSIS
       mkinitrd [-fv] [--with=module] [--preload=module]
                [--omit-scsi-modules] [--omit-raid-modules]
                [--version] [--fstab=fstab] image
                kernel-version

DESCRIPTION
       mkinitrd creates filesystem images which are suitable  for
       use  as Linux initial ramdisk (initrd) images. Such images
       are often used for preloading  the  block  device  modules
       (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which are needed to access the
       root filesystem. mkinitrd automatically loads IDE modules,
       all scsi_hostadapter entries and all modules in a probeall
       scsi_hostadapter .. line in  /etc/modules.conf,  and  raid
       modules  if  the system's root partition is on raid, which
       makes it simple to build and  use  kernels  using  modular
       device drivers.

       Any  module  options  specified  in  /etc/modules.conf are
       passed to the modules as they are loaded  by  the  initial
       ramdisk.

       It  honours  the  mount options of the root filesystem (if
       using Linux kernel version 2.4 or superior). It  currently
       supports  mounting  of the root filesystem in at least the
       following filesystems: ext2 (e.g. Linux native), reiserfs,
       ext3,  jfs,  and  xfs.  It supports compressed modules. It
       also behaves nicely with the use of devfs.


OPTIONS
       -f     Allows mkinitrd  to  overwrite  an  existing  image
              file.


       --fstab=fstab
              Use  fstab  to automatically determine what type of
              filesystem  the  root  device  is   on.   Normally,
              /etc/fstab is used.


       --ifneeded
              Only  builds  the  image  if there are modules that
              need to be loaded at boot time.


       --omit-scsi-modules
              Do not load any scsi modules, including  'scsi_mod'
              and 'sd_mod' modules, even if they are present.


       --omit-raid-modules
              Do  not  load  any raid modules, even if /etc/fstab
              and /etc/raidtab expect them.


       --preload=module
              Load the  module  module  in  the  initial  ramdisk
              image.  The module gets loaded before any SCSI mod­
              ules  which  are  specified  in  /etc/modules.conf.
              This option may be used as many times as necessary.


       -v     Prints out verbose information while  creating  the
              image (normally the mkinitrd runs silently).


       --version
              Prints  the  version  of mkinitrd that's being used
              and then exits.


       --with=module
              Load the modules  module  in  the  initial  ramdisk
              image.  The  module gets loaded after any SCSI mod­
              ules which are specified in /etc/modules.conf. This
              option may be used as many times as necessary.


       --tmpdir=tmpdir
              Use  tmpdir  as  temporary  directory  for mkinitrd
              operations. The underlying filesystem must be capa­
              ble  of doing loopback-mounts, so tmpfs and nfs are
              not (currently) possible.


FILES
       /dev/loop*          A block loopback  device  is  used  to
                           create  the  image,  which  makes this
                           script  useless  on  systems   without
                           block loopback support available.

       /etc/modules.conf   Specified  SCSI  modules  to be loaded
                           and module options to be used.
