CHPASSWD(8)                                           CHPASSWD(8)



NAME
       chpasswd - update password file in batch

SYNOPSIS
       chpasswd [-e]

DESCRIPTION
       chpasswd reads a file of user name and password pairs from
       standard input and uses this information to update a group
       of  existing  users.  Without the -e switch, the passwords
       are expected to be cleartext.  With  the  -e  switch,  the
       passwords are expected to be in encrypted form.  Each line
       is of the format

              user_name:password

       The named user must exist.  The supplied password will  be
       encrypted  as  necessary, and the password age updated, if
       present.

       This command is intended to be  used  in  a  large  system
       environment  where  many  accounts are created at a single
       time.

CAVEATS
       The input file must be  protected  if  it  contains  unen­
       crypted passwords.
