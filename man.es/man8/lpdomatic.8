NAME
       lpdomatic  -  Foomatic  filter  script for LPD, LPRng, and
       GNUlpr

SYNOPSIS
       lpdomatic [OPTION]... <PPD-filename>


DESCRIPTION
       The lpdomatic print filter serves as an input  filter  for
       the  lp  family  of print spoolers. The print spooler will
       use it if there is an entry if=/usr/sbin/lpdomatic in  the
       appropriate printer section in /etc/printcap. You can gen­
       erate such an entry using foomatic-configure.

       A listing of  the  attached  printer  drivers  options  is
       printed,  when  the  option docs is passed to this filter.
       This can be achieved by issuing one of the following  com­
       mands:

       for LPRng use
              echo | lpr -Z docs

       for other spoolers
              echo | lpr -J docs


   Options
       -j option (all  but  LPRng)  Pass  option  to  the printer
                 driver.  May also be read from the  environment.


       -J jobtitle
                 (LPRng  only)  Set  the  job  title to jobtitle.
                 This may be used to  set  a  title  header  when
                 printing plain text.


       -Z option (LPRng  only) Pass option to the printer driver.
