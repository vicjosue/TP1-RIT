nfsstat(8)                                             nfsstat(8)



NAME
       nfsstat - print NFS statistics

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/nfsstat [-anrcsz] [-o facility] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The nfsstat command retrieves and pretty-prints NFS kernel
       statistics. Currently,  only  server-side  statistics  are
       supported, because the NFS client does not yet collect any
       data.

OPTIONS
       -s     Print only server-side statistics. The  default  is
              to print both server and client statistics.

       -c     Print only client-side statistics.

       -n     Print  only NFS statistics. The default is to print
              both NFS and RPC information.

       -r     Print only RPC statistics.

       -z     Zero the kernel statistics counters.   This  option
              is not currently supported.

       -o facility
              Display  statistics  for  the  specified  facility,
              which must be one of:

              nfs    NFS protocol information, split  up  by  RPC
                     call.

              rpc    General RPC information.

              net    Network layer statistics, such as the number
                     of received packets, number of  TCP  connec­
                     tions, etc.

              fh     Usage  information on the server's file han­
                     dle cache, including  the  total  number  of
                     lookups,  and the number of hits and misses.

              rc     Usage information on  the  server's  request
                     reply  cache,  including the total number of
                     lookups, and the number of hits and  misses.
