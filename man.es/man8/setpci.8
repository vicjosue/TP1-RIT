NAME
       setpci - configure PCI devices

SYNOPSIS
       setpci [options] devices operations...


DESCRIPTION
       setpci  is  a  utility  for  querying  and configuring PCI
       devices.

       To make use of all the features of this program, you  need
       to  have  Linux  kernel 2.1.82 or newer which supports the
       /proc/bus/pci interface. With older kernels, the PCI util­
       ities  have  to use direct hardware access which is avail­
       able only to root and it suffers from numerous race condi­
       tions and other problems.

       All numbers are entered in hexadecimal notation.


OPTIONS
       -v     Tells  setpci  to  be  verbose and display detailed
              information about configuration space accesses.

       -f     Tells setpci not to complain when  there's  nothing
              to  do (when no devices are selected).  This option
              is intended for use in widely-distributed  configu­
              ration  scripts  where  it's  uncertain whether the
              device in question is present  in  the  machine  or
              not.

       -D     `Demo   mode'   --   simulate  configuration  space
              accesses instead of really doing them.  It's useful
              to try setpci -vD to see what your complex sequence
              of setpci operations does before you actually  exe­
              cute it.

       --version
              Shows  setpci  version.  This option should be used
              standalone.



DEVICE SELECTION
       Before each sequence of  operations  you  need  to  select
       which devices you wish that operation to affect.

       -s [[<bus>]:][<slot>][.[<func>]]
              Select devices in specified bus, slot and function.
              Each component of the device address can be omitted
              or  set as "*" meaning "any value". All numbers are
              hexadecimal.  E.g., "0:" means all devices  on  bus
              0,  "0" means all functions of device 0 on any bus,
              "0.3" selects third function of  device  0  on  all
              busses  and  ".4"  selects  only fourth function of
              each device.

       -d [<vendor>]:[<device>]
              Select devices with specified vendor and device ID.
              Both ID's are given in hexadecimal and may be omit­
              ted or given as "*" meaning "any value".


OPERATIONS
       To query value of a configuration register, just  name  it
       (either  by  typing its name or by typing register address
       with optional .B, .W  or  .L  suffix  specifying  register
       width as byte, word or longword).

       To  set a register, write reg=values where reg is the same
       you would use to query the register and values is a comma-
       separated  list  of values you want to write starting with
       the given address.


REGISTER NAMES
       setpci knows the following configuration  register  names.

PCILIB OPTIONS
       The PCI utilities use PCILIB (a portable library providing
       platform-independent functions for PCI configuration space
       access) to talk to the PCI cards.  The  following  options
       control  parameters of the library, especially what access
       method it uses.  By default, PCILIB uses the first  avail­
       able  access  method  and  displays no debugging messages.
       Each switch is accompanied by a list of  hardware/software
       configurations it's supported in.


       -P <dir>
              Use  Linux 2.1 style configuration access to direc­
              tory <dir> instead of /proc/bus/pci. (Linux 2.1  or
              newer only)

       -H1    Use  direct hardware access via Intel configuration
              mechanism 1. (i386 and compatible only)

       -H2    Use direct hardware access via Intel  configuration
              mechanism  2.  Warning:  This  method  is  able  to
              address only first 16 devices on  any  bus  and  it
              seems  to  be very unrealiable in many cases. (i386
              and compatible only)

       -S     Use PCI access syscalls. (Linux on Alpha and Ultra­
              Sparc only)

       -F <file>
              Extract  all information from given file containing
              output of lspci -x. This is very useful for  analy­
              sis  of  user-supplied bug reports, because you can
              display the hardware configuration in any  way  you
              want  without disturbing the user with requests for
              more dumps. (All systems)

       -G     Increase debug level of the library. (All systems)


EXAMPLES
       `setpci -d *:* latency_timer=40' sets the latency timer to
       64 (40 hexadecimal).

       `setpci -s 0 device_id vendor_id' lists ID's of devices in
       slot 0 in all busses.

       `setpci  -s  12:3.4  3c.l=1,2,3'  writes  longword  1   to
       register  3c,  2  to  register  3d and 3 to register 3e of
       device at bus 12, slot 3, function 4.
