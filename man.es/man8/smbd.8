NAME
       smbd - server to provide SMB/CIFS services to clients

SYNOPSIS
       smbd  [ -D ]  [ -a ]  [ -i ]  [ -o ]  [ -P ]  [ -h ]  [ -V
       ]  [ -d <debug level> ]  [ -l  <log  directory>  ]   [  -p
       <port  number> ]  [ -O <socket option> ]  [ -s <configura­
       tion file> ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of the Samba suite.

       smbd is the server daemon that  provides  filesharing  and
       printing services to Windows clients.  The server provides
       filespace and printer services to clients  using  the  SMB
       (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible with the LanManager
       protocol,  and  can  service  LanManager  clients.   These
       include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Win­
       dows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000,  OS/2,  DAVE  for
       Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.

       An  extensive  description of the services that the server
       can provide is given in the man page for the configuration
       file  controlling  the  attributes  of those services (see
       smb.conf(5) services, but will concentrate on the adminis­
       trative aspects of running the server.

       Please  note  that there are significant security implica­
       tions to running this server, and the smb.conf(5)  manpage
       should  be regarded as mandatory reading before proceeding
       with installation.

       A session is created whenever a client requests one.  Each
       client  gets  a  copy of the server for each session. This
       copy then services all connections made by the client dur­
       ing that session. When all connections from its client are
       closed, the copy of the server for that client terminates.

       The  configuration  file,  and any files that it includes,
       are automatically reloaded every minute, if  they  change.
       You  can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.
       Reloading the configuration file will not  affect  connec­
       tions  to  any service that is already established. Either
       the user will have to disconnect from the service, or smbd
       killed and restarted.

OPTIONS
       -D     If  specified,  this parameter causes the server to
              operate as a daemon. That is,  it  detaches  itself
              and  runs  in  the background, fielding requests on
              the appropriate port. Operating  the  server  as  a
              daemon  is  the recommended way of running smbd for
              servers that provide more than casual use file  and
              print  services.  This switch is assumed if smbd is
              executed on the command line of a shell.

       -a     If this parameter is specified, each new connection
              will  append log messages to the log file.  This is
              the default.

       -i     If this parameter is specified it causes the server
              to  run  "interactively",  not as a daemon, even if
              the server is executed on the  command  line  of  a
              shell.  Setting this parameter negates the implicit
              deamon mode when run from the command line.

       -o     If this parameter is specified, the log files  will
              be  overwritten  when opened. By default, smbd will
              append entries to the log files.

       -P     Passive option. Causes smbd not to send any network
              traffic  out.  Used for debugging by the developers
              only.

       -h     Prints the help information (usage) for smbd.

       -v     Prints the version number for smbd.

       -d <debug level>
              debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10. The  default
              value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

              The  higher  this  value,  the  more detail will be
              logged to the log files about the activities of the
              server.  At level 0, only critical errors and seri­
              ous warnings will be logged. Level 1 is  a  reason­
              able  level for day to day running - it generates a
              small amount of information about  operations  car­
              ried out.

              Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts
              of log data, and should only be used when  investi­
              gating  a  problem. Levels above 3 are designed for
              use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of
              log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

              Note that specifying this parameter here will over­
              ride the log levelfile.

       -l <log directory>
              If specified, log directory specifies a log  direc­
              tory  into  which  the  "log.smbd" log file will be
              created for informational and debug  messages  from
              the running server. The log file generated is never
              removed by the server although its size may be con­
              trolled   by   the  max  log  size  option  in  the
              smb.conf(5)file.

              The default log directory is specified  at  compile
              time.

       -O <socket options>
              See the socket options parameter in the smb.conf(5)
              file for details.

       -p <port number>
              port  number  is  a  positive  integer  value.  The
              default value if this parameter is not specified is
              139.

              This number is the port number that  will  be  used
              when  making  connections to the server from client
              software. The standard (well-known) port number for
              the  SMB over TCP is 139, hence the default. If you
              wish to run the server as an ordinary  user  rather
              than  as root, most systems will require you to use
              a port number greater than 1024 - ask  your  system
              administrator   for   help   if  you  are  in  this
              situation.

              In order for  the  server  to  be  useful  by  most
              clients,  should  you  configure it on a port other
              than 139, you will require  port  redirection  ser­
              vices on port 139, details of which are outlined in
              rfc1002.txt section 4.3.5.

              This parameter is not normally specified except  in
              the above situation.

       -s <configuration file>
              The   file  specified  contains  the  configuration
              details required by the server. The information  in
              this file includes server-specific information such
              as what printcap file to use, as well  as  descrip­
              tions  of  all  the  services that the server is to
              provide. See  smb.conf(5)for more information.  The
              default  configuration  file  name is determined at
              compile time.

FILES
       /etc/inetd.conf
              If the server is to be run by the  inetd  meta-dae­
              mon, this file must contain suitable startup infor­
              mation    for    the    meta-daemon.    See     the
              UNIX_INSTALL.html document for details.

       /etc/rc
              or   whatever  initialization  script  your  system
              uses).

              If running the server as a daemon at startup,  this
              file  will  need  to contain an appropriate startup
              sequence for the server. See the  UNIX_INSTALL.html
              document for details.

       /etc/services
              If  running  the  server via the meta-daemon inetd,
              this file must contain a mapping  of  service  name
              (e.g., netbios-ssn) to service port (e.g., 139) and
              protocol    type    (e.g.,    tcp).     See     the
              UNIX_INSTALL.html document for details.

       /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
              This is the default location of the smb.conf server
              configuration file. Other common places  that  sys­
              tems  install this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf
              and /etc/smb.conf.

              This file describes all the services the server  is
              to  make  available to clients. See  smb.conf(5)for
              more information.

LIMITATIONS
       On some systems smbd cannot change uid back to root  after
       a setuid() call. Such systems are called trapdoor uid sys­
       tems. If you have such a system, you  will  be  unable  to
       connect  from  a  client  (such  as a PC) as two different
       users at once. Attempts to connect the  second  user  will
       result in access denied or similar.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PRINTER
              If  no  printer name is specified to printable ser­
              vices, most systems will  use  the  value  of  this
              variable (or lp if this variable is not defined) as
              the name of the printer to use. This  is  not  spe­
              cific to the server, however.

PAM INTERACTION
       Samba  uses  PAM for authentication (when presented with a
       plaintext password), for account checking (is this account
       disabled?)  and  for  session  management.  The degree too
       which samba supports PAM is restricted by the  limitations
       of  the SMB protocol and the obey pam restricions smb.conf
       paramater. When this is set,  the  following  restrictions
       apply:

       · Account  Validation: All acccesses to a samba server are
         checked against PAM to see if the account is vaild,  not
         disabled  and  is  permitted to login at this time. This
         also applies to encrypted logins.

       · Session Management: When not using share level secuirty,
         users  must  pass  PAM's session checks before access is
         granted. Note however, that this is  bypassed  in  share
         level  secuirty.  Note also that some older pam configu­
         ration files may need a line added for session  support.

VERSION
       This  man  page  is  correct  for version 2.2 of the Samba
       suite.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Most diagnostics issued by the  server  are  logged  in  a
       specified log file. The log file name is specified at com­
       pile time, but may be overridden on the command line.

       The number and nature of diagnostics available depends  on
       the  debug level used by the server. If you have problems,
       set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.

       Most messages are  reasonably  self-explanatory.  Unfortu­
       nately,  at  the time this man page was created, there are
       too many diagnostics available in the source code to  war­
       rant  describing  each and every diagnostic. At this stage
       your best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect
       the  conditions  that gave rise to the diagnostics you are
       seeing.

SIGNALS
       Sending the smbd a SIGHUP will  cause  it  to  reload  its
       smb.conf configuration file within a short period of time.

       To shut down a user's smbd process it is recommended  that
       SIGKILL (-9) NOT be used, except as a last resort, as this
       may leave the shared memory area in an inconsistent state.
       The  safe way to terminate an smbd is to send it a SIGTERM
       (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.

       The debug log level of smbd may be raised or lowered using
       smbcontrol(1)  program  (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer
       used in Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient problems to
       be  diagnosed,  whilst still running at a normally low log
       level.

       Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write,  they
       are  not  re-entrant  in  smbd. This you should wait until
       smbd is in a state of waiting for an incoming  SMB  before
       issuing  them.  It is possible to make the signal handlers
       safe by un-blocking the signals before the select call and
       re-blocking  them after, however this would affect perfor­
       mance.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
