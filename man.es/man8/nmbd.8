NAME
       nmbd  -  NetBIOS  name  server to provide NetBIOS  over IP
       naming services to clients

SYNOPSIS
       nmbd [ -D ]  [ -a ]  [ -i ]  [ -o ]  [ -P ]  [ -h ]  [  -V
       ]   [ -d <debug level> ]  [ -H <lmhosts file> ]  [ -l <log
       directory> ]  [ -n <primary netbios name> ]   [  -p  <port
       number> ]  [ -s <configuration file> ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of the Samba suite.

       nmbd is a server that understands and can reply to NetBIOS
       over IP name service  requests,  like  those  produced  by
       SMB/CIFS  clients  such  as  Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT,
       Windows 2000, and LanManager clients. It also participates
       in  the browsing protocols which make up the Windows "Net­
       work Neighborhood" view.

       SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish  to  locate
       an  SMB/CIFS  server.  That  is, they wish to know what IP
       number a specified host is using.

       Amongst  other  services,  nmbd  will  listen   for   such
       requests, and if its own NetBIOS name is specified it will
       respond with the IP number of the host it is  running  on.
       Its  "own NetBIOS name" is by default the primary DNS name
       of the host it is running on, but this can  be  overridden
       with  the  -n  option  (see OPTIONS below). Thus nmbd will
       reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional
       names  for nmbd to respond on can be set via parameters in
       the  smb.conf(5)configuration file.

       nmbd can also be used as a  WINS  (Windows  Internet  Name
       Server)  server. What this basically means is that it will
       act as a WINS database server, creating  a  database  from
       name  registration  requests that it receives and replying
       to queries from clients for these names.

       In addition, nmbd can act as a WINS proxy, relaying broad­
       cast  queries  from  clients that do not understand how to
       talk the WINS protocol to a WIN server.

OPTIONS
       -D     If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to operate
              as  a  daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs
              in the background, fielding requests on the  appro­
              priate  port.  By  default,  nmbd will operate as a
              daemon if launched from a command shell.  nmbd  can
              also   be  operated  from  the  inetd  meta-daemon,
              although this is not recommended.

       -a     If this parameter is specified, each new connection
              will  append log messages to the log file.  This is
              the default.

       -i     If this parameter is specified it causes the server
              to  run  "interactively",  not as a daemon, even if
              the server is executed on the  command  line  of  a
              shell.  Setting this parameter negates the implicit
              deamon mode when run from the command line.

       -o     If this parameter is specified, the log files  will
              be  overwritten  when opened. By default, smbd will
              append entries to the log files.

       -h     Prints the help information (usage) for nmbd.

       -H <filename>
              NetBIOS lmhosts file. The lmhosts file is a list of
              NetBIOS names to IP addresses that is loaded by the
              nmbd server and used via the name resolution mecha­
              nism   name  resolve  order  to resolve any NetBIOS
              name queries needed by the server.  Note  that  the
              contents  of  this  file  are  NOT  used by nmbd to
              answer any name queries.  Adding  a  line  to  this
              file affects name NetBIOS resolution from this host
              ONLY.

              The default path to  this  file  is  compiled  into
              Samba as part of the build process. Common defaults
              are                   /usr/local/samba/lib/lmhosts,
              /usr/samba/lib/lmhosts  or  /etc/lmhosts.  See  the
              lmhosts(5)man page for details on the  contents  of
              this file.

       -V     Prints the version number for nmbd.

       -d <debug level>
              debuglevel  is an integer from 0 to 10. The default
              value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

              The higher this value,  the  more  detail  will  be
              logged to the log files about the activities of the
              server. At level 0, only critical errors and  seri­
              ous  warnings  will be logged. Level 1 is a reason­
              able level for day to day running - it generates  a
              small  amount  of information about operations car­
              ried out.

              Levels above 1 will generate  considerable  amounts
              of  log data, and should only be used when investi­
              gating a problem. Levels above 3 are  designed  for
              use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of
              log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

              Note that specifying this parameter here will over­
              ride  the log level parameter in the  smb.conffile.

       -l <log directory>
              The -l parameter specifies a directory  into  which
              the  "log.nmbd" log file will be created for opera­
              tional data from the running nmbd server.

              The default log directory is compiled into Samba as
              part  of  the  build  process.  Common defaults are
              /usr/local/samba/var/log.nmb,
              /usr/samba/var/log.nmb or /var/log/log.nmb.

       -n <primary NetBIOS name>
              This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name
              that Samba uses for itself. This  is  identical  to
              setting the  NetBIOS nameparameter in the smb.conf­
              file. However, a command  line  setting  will  take
              precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -p <UDP port number>
              UDP  port number is a positive integer value.  This
              option changes the default UDP  port  number  (nor­
              mally  137)  that nmbd responds to name queries on.
              Don't use this option unless you are an expert,  in
              which case you won't need help!

       -s <configuration file>
              The default configuration file name is set at build
              time, typically as   /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf,
              but  this  may be changed when Samba is autoconfig­
              ured.

              The  file  specified  contains  the   configuration
              details required by the server. See  smb.conf(5)for
              more information.

FILES
       /etc/inetd.conf
              If the server is to be run by the  inetd  meta-dae­
              mon, this file must contain suitable startup infor­
              mation    for    the    meta-daemon.    See     the
              UNIX_INSTALL.htmldocument for details.

       /etc/rc
              or   whatever  initialization  script  your  system
              uses).

              If running the server as a daemon at startup,  this
              file  will  need  to contain an appropriate startup
              sequence for the server. See the UNIX_INSTALL.html­
              document for details.

       /etc/services
              If  running  the  server via the meta-daemon inetd,
              this file must contain a mapping  of  service  name
              (e.g., netbios-ssn) to service port (e.g., 139) and
              protocol    type    (e.g.,    tcp).     See     the
              UNIX_INSTALL.html document for details.

       /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
              This is the default location of the smb.conf server
              configuration file. Other common places  that  sys­
              tems  install this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf
              and /etc/smb.conf.

              When run as a WINS server  (see  the  wins  support
              parameter  in  the smb.conf(5) man page), nmbd will
              store the WINS database in the file wins.dat in the
              var/locks directory configured under wherever Samba
              was configured to install itself.

              If nmbd is acting as  a   browse  master  (see  the
              local master parameter in the smb.conf(5) man page,
              nmbd will store the browsing database in  the  file
              browse.dat  in  the  var/locks directory configured
              under wherever  Samba  was  configured  to  install
              itself.

SIGNALS
       To  shut  down  an  nmbd  process  it  is recommended that
       SIGKILL (-9) NOT be used, except as a last resort, as this
       may leave the name database in an inconsistent state.  The
       correct way to terminate nmbd is  to  send  it  a  SIGTERM
       (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.

       nmbd  will  accept SIGHUP, which will cause it to dump out
       its  namelists  into  the  file  namelist.debug   in   the
       /usr/local/samba/var/locks  directory  (or  the  var/locks
       directory configured under wherever Samba  was  configured
       to  install itself). This will also cause nmbd to dump out
       its server database in the log.nmb file.

       The debug log level of nmbd may be raised or lowered using
       smbcontrol(1)  (SIGUSR[1|2]  signals are no longer used in
       Samba 2.2). This is to  allow  transient  problems  to  be
       diagnosed,  whilst  still  running  at  a normally low log
       level.

       The  original  Samba  software  and related utilities were
       created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by  the
       Samba  Team  as  an Open Source project similar to the way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written  by  Karl  Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another excellent piece of Open Source  software,  avail­

       Samba  2.0  release  by  Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
