QUOTAON(8)                                             QUOTAON(8)



NAME
       quotaon, quotaoff - turn filesystem quotas on and off

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/quotaon [ -vugf ] filesystem...
       /usr/sbin/quotaon [ -avugf ]

       /usr/sbin/quotaoff [ -vug ] [ -x state ] filesystem...
       /usr/sbin/quotaoff [ -avug ]

DESCRIPTION
   quotaon
       quotaon announces to the system that disk quotas should be
       enabled on one or more filesystems. The  filesystem  quota
       files  must be present in the root directory of the speci­
       fied filesystem and be named either aquota.user (for  ver­
       sion 2 user quota), quota.user (for version 1 user quota),
       aquota.group (for version 2 group quota),  or  quota.group
       (for version 1 group quota).

       XFS  filesystems  are a special case - XFS considers quota
       information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling  to
       provide  a  higher  level guarantee of consistency.  There
       are two components to the XFS disk quota system:  account­
       ing and limit enforcement.  Except in the case of the root
       filesystem, XFS filesystems require that quota  accounting
       be  turned on at mount time.  It is possible to enable and
       disable limit enforcement  on  any  XFS  filesystem  after
       quota  accounting is already turned on.  The default is to
       turn on both accounting and enforcement.

       The XFS  quota  implementation  does  not  maintain  quota
       information  in user-visible files, but rather stores this
       information internally.

   quotaoff
       quotaoff  announces  to  the  system  that  the  specified
       filesystems should have any disk quotas turned off.

OPTIONS
   quotaon
       -a     All  automatically  mounted (no noauto option) non-
              NFS filesystems in /etc/fstab with quotas will have
              their  quotas  turned on.  This is normally used at
              boot time to enable quotas.

       -v     Display a message for each filesystem where  quotas
              are turned on.

       -u     Manipulate user quotas. This is the default.

       -g     Manipulate group quotas.

       -f     Make  quotaon behave like being called as quotaoff.

   quotaoff
       -a     Force all filesystems in /etc/fstab to  have  their
              quotas disabled.

       -v     Display a message for each filesystem affected.

       -u     Manipulate user quotas. This is the default.

       -g     Manipulate group quotas.

       -x delete
              Free  up  the  space used to hold quota information
              (maintained internally) within XFS.  This option is
              only applicable to XFS, and is silently ignored for
              other filesystem types.  It can only be used  on  a
              filesystem with quota previously turned off.

       -x enforce
              Switch  off  limit  enforcement for XFS filesystems
              (perform quota accounting only).   This  option  is
              only applicable to XFS, and is silently ignored for
              other filesystem types.


XFS EXAMPLES
       Turning on quotas on a non-root XFS filesystem
       Use mount(8) or /etc/fstab option  quota  to  enable  both
       accounting  and limit enforcement.  quotaon utility cannot
       be used for this purpose.

       Turning on quotas on an XFS root filesystem
       Use quotaon -v /,  and  reboot(8).   This  procedure  will
       enable both accounting and limit enforcement.

       Turning off quota limit enforcement on any XFS filesystem
       Make  sure  that quota accounting and enforcement are both
       turned on using repquota -s.  Use quotaoff -vo to  disable
       limit  enforcement.  This may be done while the filesystem
       is mounted.

       Turning on quota limit enforcement on any XFS filesystem
       Make  sure  that  quota  accounting  is  turned  on  using
       repquota  -s.  Use quotaon -v.  This may be done while the
       filesystem is mounted.

FILES
       aquota.user or aquota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root
                           (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user or quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem  root
                           (version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
       /etc/fstab          default filesystems
