NAME
       isapnp - Configure ISA Plug-and-Play devices.

SYNOPSIS
       isapnp [ --help ] [ --version ] conffile

DESCRIPTION
       isapnp  will  carry  out  the instructions provided in the
       conffile to configure ISA PnP cards.  isapnp must read  in
       the  entire configuration file successfully before it will
       execute the commands: this is to ensure  the  instructions
       are consistent and valid.
       The  format  of  the  configuration  file  is described in
       isapnp.conf(5).

       In version 1.16 and later of  isapnptools,  isapnp  checks
       resources are available as the devices are configured.  If
       there is a conflict, a diagnostic message  is  given,  and
       the  program  can  be made to abort if required by placing
       the appropriate settings in the configuration file.

       In version 1.18 and later of isapnptools, conffile may  be
       '-', meaning read the configuration file from stdin.

       isapnp  will  run with real-time scheduling if possible to
       achieve the required IO timings. This will  lock  out  all
       normal  programs  while  it  executes. In version 1.19 and
       later of isapnptools, isapnp will only run  in  this  mode
       for 5 seconds, it then reverts to standard scheduling like
       any other program. Previous versions should  only  be  run
       from  a standard console as ^C will kill it from there. If
       you run the command remotely (and X counts as remote), you
       will  not be able to kill it as no other programs can run.


   Options
       -h, --help
              Show a help summary.

       -v, --version
              Print the isapnptools version number on stderr.


ERRORS
       If the configuration file cannot be  opened,  the  program
       aborts immediately with a suitable message.

       If an error occurs later, a message is printed to standard
       error in the form:

       file:lineno -- Warning/Fatal - message

       where

       file   The configuration file being read ('-') for  stdin.

       lineno The  line  number  that  the  error  occured at (or
              noticed).

       Warning/Fatal
              Warning if the error was not serious and  execution
              can  continue, Fatal if the program cannot proceed.

       message
              The error message, hopefully meaningful, see below.


       Unable to allocate memory for action list processing

              The  program  has run out of memory and will abort.
              Fit more memory, or add more swap  space.  This  is
              extremely unlikely as isapnp is normally run during
              boot up, when there are no users logged on.


       ISOLATE called twice, or after CSN - clearing board count

              You had an (ISOLATE..) after a  previous  occurance
              of (ISOLATE..) or (CSN..).  The program will rescan
              for boards. You should fix your script to only scan
              for  boards  once,  by  removing  one  of the above
              statements.

       IRQ2 is not a valid selection, changing it  to  IRQ9  (See
       clarifications 4.6.2)

              Your configuration file attempted  to  configure  a
              board to use IRQ2. This is invalid according to the
              clarifications to  the  PnP  ISA  spec  v1.0a,  and
              should be changed to use IRQ9, which has been done.
              You should change your configuration  file  to  use
              IRQ9 in the first place.

       resource conflict allocating IRQx (see ...)

              Your  configuration file has attempted to program a
              board to use an IRQ line which is already  used  by
              something else. The see ... bit tells you where the
              IRQ line was first flagged as being in use.  Change
              the  script to use a different IRQ line, or fix the
              information being provided if the line really isn't
              already used.

       resource  conflict allocating n bytes of IO at x (see ...)

              Your  configuration file has attempted to program a
              board to use IO ports which  are  already  used  by
              something else. The see ... bit tells you where the
              ports were first flagged as being  in  use.  Change
              the  script  to  use  different  ports,  or fix the
              information being  provided  if  the  ports  really
              aren't already used.

       IO range check attempted while device activated

              Your  configuration file has attempted to carry out
              an IO range check on a  device  which  has  already
              been  configured and activated. You must either not
              attempt the check, or deactivate the device  before
              the  check.  This  error  is a sign that you are on
              shakey ground. If the device is already  activated,
              and you are running isapnp for the first time, then
              some other program has already activated the device
              (may  be  the  BIOS, or some of the cleverer kernel
              drivers). You probably shouldn't be  attempting  to
              configure the device at all. There could already be
              drivers accessing the card.

       IO range check failed for n bytes of IO at x

              The IO range check failed.  This  is  a  sign  that
              there  is  a  conflict  of port addresses with some
              other device. Reassign the IO ports for this device
              (or the other one if you know what is is and how to
              do it).

       resource conflict allocating DMAx (see ...)

              Your configuration file has attempted to program  a
              board  to  use  a DMA line which is already used by
              something else. The see ... bit tells you where the
              DMA  line was first flagged as being in use. Change
              the script to use a different DMA line, or fix  the
              information being provided if the line really isn't
              already used.

       resource conflict allocating Memory at a (see ...)

              Your configuration file has attempted to program  a
              board  to  use  memory  addresses which are already
              used by something else. The see ... bit  tells  you
              where  the addresses were first flagged as being in
              use. Change the script to use different  addresses,
              or  fix  the  information  being  provided  if  the
              addresses really aren't already used.

              The following messages may also occur:

       REALTIME operation timeout exceeded - Switching to  normal
       scheduling

              The program has been running for more than  5  sec­
              onds,  so  something is probably wrong. Rather than
              lock up your machine, it is switching out of  real-
              time mode so that other programs can run again. The
              program will now probably run slower. If this  mes­
              sage occurs, you may want to kill isapnp.

       Couldn't  clear  real-time scheduling, may continue to use
       all CPU for a while

              The  program  has been running for more than 5 sec­
              onds, but  the  attempt  to  leave  real-time  mode
              failed (impossible !), so there will be a further 5
              second delay, then if it hasn't  finished  by  then
              the program will kill itself.

       Time expired - aborting program

              The above happened (even though it's impossible !).
              The program is killing itself.

       Port address xx (0x..) out of range 0x203..0x3ff

              You have provided an invalid READPORT address - fix
              it.

       READPORT not set

              You  have not specified a READPORT, and not done an
              (ISOLATE..) which would find one,  so  the  program
              cannot  proceed. Either specify a READPORT or carry
              out an (ISOLATE..).

       Read port x cannot be allocated - resource  conflict  (see
       ...)

              The READPORT is already in use. Choose another.

       Timeout attempting to read resource  data  -  is  READPORT
       correct ?

              The status bit to  signal  the  resource  data  was
              valid  never  got  set, this could be due to a con­
              flict with your choice  of  READPORT  address,  try
              another.

       LD  setting  verify failed, this may not be a problem. Try
       adding (VERIFYLD N) to the top of your script

              Reading  back the logical device selection register
              failed. It appears  some  boards  do  this  if  you
              access  the  devices in the wrong order. Do like it
              says, and add (VERIFYLD  N)  to  the  top  of  your
              script and see if the board configures ok.

       Can only poke bytes

              You've  tried  to  poke  a  value outside the range
              0..255. Fix your script.

       Don't know what to do with ... on or around line x

              You've got a syntax error somewhere. If the word is
              a  valid  command,  you've  probably got braces not
              matching. Fix your script.

       Unable to get io permission for WRITE_DATA

              You are  not  superuser.  Only  superuser  has  the
              required permissions to run isapnp.

       nanosleep failed

              Impossible ! If it happens, the program will to run
              in real-time mode.
