USERDEL(8)                                             USERDEL(8)



NAME
       userdel - Delete a user account and related files

SYNOPSIS
       userdel [-r] login

DESCRIPTION
       The  userdel  command  modifies  the system account files,
       deleting all entries that refer to login.  The named  user
       must exist.

       -r     Files  in the user's home directory will be removed
              along with the home directory itself and the user's
              mail  spool.   Files  located in other file systems
              will have to be searched for and deleted  manually.

FILES
       /etc/passwd - user account information
       /etc/shadow - secure user account information
       /etc/group - group information

CAVEATS
       userdel  will  not  allow  you to remove an account if the
       user is currently logged in.  You must  kill  any  running
       processes  which  belong to an account that you are delet­
       ing.  You may not remove any  NIS  attributes  on  an  NIS
       client.  This must be performed on the NIS server.
