PMAP_SET(8)         Linux Programmer's Manual         PMAP_SET(8)



NAME
       pmap_set - set the list of registered RPC programs

SYNOPSIS
       pmap_set

DESCRIPTION
       The  pmap_set  command  can  be  used to restart a running
       portmapper or to set the list of registered  RPC  programs
       on  the  local  host.  If  you  want to use the program to
       restart the portmapper you have to redirect the output  of
       pmap_dump  to  a  file.  After  this  you  can restart the
       portmapper and restore the list of the registered RPC pro­
       grams  by  feeding the output of pmap_dump to the pmap_set
       command.
