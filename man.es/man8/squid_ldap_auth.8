NAME
       squid_ldap_auth - Squid LDAP authentication helper

SYNOPSIS
       squid_ldap_auth [options] ldap_server_name

DESCRIPTION
       This helper allows Squid to connect to a LDAP directory to
       validate the user name and password of Basic HTTP  authen­
       tication.

       -b basedn (REQUIRED)
              Specifies  the  base  DN  under which the users are
              located.

       -f filter
              LDAP search filter to locate the user DN.  Required
              if  the users are in a hierarchy below the base DN,
              or if the login name is not what  builds  the  user
              specific part of the users DN.

              The  search filter can contain up to 15 occurrences
              of %s which will be replaced by the username, as in
              "uid=%s" for RFC2037 directories.

       -u userattr
              The  name of the DN attribute which makes the user­
              name.  Defaults to  RFC2307  standard  "uid".  Some
              LDAP  directories  uses  "cn" instead of "uid" (for
              example Microsoft Active Directory).

              This is used to directly construct a user  DN  when
              the -f search option is not used.

       -s base|one|sub
              search scope when performing user DN searches spec­
              ified by the -f option.

              base object only, one level below the  base  object
              or subtree below the base object

       -D binddn -w password
              The  DN  and  password  to bind as while performing
              searches. Required by the -f flag if the  directory
              does not allow anonymous searches.

              As  the  password needs to be printed in plain text
              in your Squid configuration it is  strongly  recom­
              mended  to  use  a  account with minimal associated
              privileges.  This to limit the damage in case some­
              one could get hold of a copy of your Squid configu­
              ration file.

       -p     Use a persistent LDAP connection. Normally the LDAP
              connection is only open while validating a username
              to preserve resources  at  the  LDAP  server.  This
              option  causes the LDAP connection to be kept open,
              allowing it to be reused for further  user  valida­
              tions. Recommended for larger installations.

       -R     do not follow referrals

       -a never|always|search|find
              when to dereference aliases

              never  dereference aliases (default), always deref­
              erence aliases, only while  searching  or  only  to
              find the base object

EXAMPLES
       For  directories  using  the  RFC2307 layout with a single
       domain, all you need to specify is  usually  the  base  DN
       under where your users are located, and the server name.

              squid_ldap_auth    -b   ou=people,dc=your,dc=domain
              ldapserver

       If you have sub-domains then you need to use a search fil­
       ter to locate the users

              squid_ldap_auth   -b  dc=your,dc=domain  -f  uid=%s
              ldapserver

       Or if the user attribute of the user DN is "cn" instead of
       "uid"  and you do not want to have to search for the users
       then you could use something like  the  following  example
       for Active Directory:

              squid_ldap_auth -u cn -b cn=Users,dc=your,dc=domain
              ldapserver

       If you want to search for the user DN and  your  directory
       does  not  allow anonymous searches then you must also use
       the -D and -w flags to specify a user DN and  password  to
       log  in  as  to  perform the searches, as in the following
       complex Active Directory example

              squid_ldap_auth  -p  -R  -b  dc=your,dc=domain   -D
              cn=squid,cn=users,dc=your,dc=domain -w secretsquid­
              password -f  userPrincipalName=%s  activedirectory­
              server

KNOWN ISSUES
       Will crash if other % values than %s is used in -f, or  if
       more than 15 %s is used.

QUESTIONS

       list/friend  if  the question is more related to LDAP than
       Squid.
