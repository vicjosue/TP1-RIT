PMAP_DUMP(8)        Linux Programmer's Manual        PMAP_DUMP(8)



NAME
       pmap_dump - print a list of all registered RPC programs

SYNOPSIS
       pmap_dump

DESCRIPTION
       The  pmap_dump  command  can  be used to restart a running
       portmapper or to print a list of all registered  RPC  pro­
       grams on the local host. If you want to use the program to
       restart the portmapper you have to redirect the output  of
       pmap_dump  to  a  file.  After  this  you  can restart the
       portmapper and restore the list of the registered RPC pro­
       grams  by  feeding the output of pmap_dump to the pmap_set
       command.
