RESIZE2FS(8)                                         RESIZE2FS(8)



NAME
       resize2fs - ext2 file system resizer

SYNOPSIS
       resize2fs [ -d debug-flags ] [ -f ] [ -F ] [ -p ] device [
       size ]

DESCRIPTION
       The resize2fs program will resize ext2 file  systems.   It
       can  be  used  to  enlarge  or  shrink an ext2 file system
       located on device so that it will have  size  blocks.   If
       the  size  parameter  is not specified, it will default to
       the size of the partition.  The size parameter  may  never
       be larger than the size of the partition.

       The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of par­
       titions.  If you wish to enlarge a  filesystem,  you  must
       first  make sure you can expand the size of the underlying
       partition first.  This  can  be  done  using  fdisk(8)  by
       deleting  the  partition  and  recreating it with a larger
       size.  When recreating the partition, make sure you create
       it with the same starting disk cylinder as before!  Other­
       wise, the resize operation will certainly  not  work,  and
       you may lose your entire filesystem.

       If  you  wish  to  shrink the an ext2 partition, first use
       resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then you  may
       use  fdisk(8)  to  shrink the size of the partition.  When
       shrinking the size of the partition, make sure you do  not
       make  it smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!

OPTIONS
       -d debug-flags
              Turns on various resize2fs debugging  features,  if
              they  have  been  compiled into the binary.  debug-
              flags should be computed by adding the  numbers  of
              the desired features from the following list:
                   1    - Print out all disk I/O
                   2    - Debug block relocations
                   8    - Debug inode relocations
                   16   - Debug moving the inode table

       -p     Prints  out  a  percentage completion bars for each
              resize2fs operation, so  that  the  user  can  keep
              track of what the program is doing.

       -f     Forces  resize2fs  to  proceed  with the filesystem
              resize operation,  overriding  some  safety  checks
              which resize2fs normally enforces.

       -F     Flush  the filesystem device's buffer caches before
              beginning.  Only really useful for doing  resize2fs
              time trials.
