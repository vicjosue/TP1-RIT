NAME
       lpc - line printer control program

SYNOPSIS
       lpc [ command [ parameter(s) ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpc provides limited control over printer and class queues
       provided by CUPS. It can also be used to query  the  state
       of queues.

       If  no  command is specified on the command-line, lpc will
       display a prompt and accept  commands  from  the  standard
       input.

COMMANDS
       The  lpc  program accepts a subset of commands accepted by
       the Berkeley lpc program of the same name:

       exit
            Exits the command interpreter.

       help [command]
            Displays a short help message.

       quit
            Exits the command interpreter.

       status [queue]
            Displays the status of one or more printer  or  class
            queues.

       ? [command]
            Display a short help message.

LIMITATIONS
       Since  lpc is geared towards the Berkeley printing system,
       it is impossible to use lpc to configure printer or  class
       queues  provided  by  CUPS.  To configure printer or class
       queues you must use  the  lpadmin(8)  command  or  another
       CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  CUPS  version  of  lpc  does not implement all of the
       standard Berkeley commands.
