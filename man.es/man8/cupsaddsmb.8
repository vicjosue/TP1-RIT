NAME
       cupsaddsmb - export printers to samba for windows clients

SYNOPSIS
       cupsaddsmb [ -a ] [ -U user ] [ -v ]
       cupsaddsmb [ -u user ] [ -v ] [ printer1 ... printerN ]

DESCRIPTION
       cupsaddsmb exports printers to the SAMBA software (version
       2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows  clients.  Depending
       on  the  SAMBA  configuration,  you  may need to provide a
       password to export the printers. This program requires the
       Adobe PostScript printer driver files described below.

       The  -a option exports all known printers. Otherwise, only
       the named printers are exported.

       The -U option specifies the  print  admin  username  which
       defaults to your current username.

       The -v option specifies that verbose information should be
       shown and is  useful  for  debugging  SAMBA  configuration
       problems.

SAMBA CONFIGURATION
       cupsaddsmb  uses  the  new  RPC-based  printing support in
       SAMBA 2.2.x to provide printer drivers and  PPD  files  to
       Windows  client machines. In order to use this functional­
       ity, you must first  configure  SAMBA  (via  the  smb.conf
       file)  to  support  printing  through  CUPS  and provide a
       printer driver download share, as follows:

           [global]
            load printers = yes
            printing = cups
            printcap name = cups

           [printers]
            comment = All Printers
            path = /var/spool/samba
            browseable = no
            public = yes
            guest ok = yes
            writable = no
            printable = yes
            printer admin = root

           [print$]
            comment = Printer Drivers
            path = /etc/samba/drivers
            browseable = yes
            guest ok = no
            read only = yes
            write list = root

       This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation of
       SAMBA;  adjust  the  [printers]  and  [print$] share paths
       accordingly on your system as needed.

ADOBE POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS
       cupsaddsmb uses the Adobe PostScript printer  drivers  for
       Windows,  which  are available for download from the Adobe
       web site (http://www.adobe.com). Once you  have  extracted
       the driver files, create a "drivers" directory in the CUPS
       data directory  (usually  /usr/share/cups)  and  copy  the
       Adobe files using UPPERCASE filenames, as follows:

           ADFONTS.MFM
           ADOBEPS4.DRV
           ADOBEPS4.HLP
           ADOBEPS5.DLL
           ADOBEPSU.DLL
           ADOBEPSU.HLP
           DEFPRTR2.PPD
           ICONLIB.DLL
           PSMON.DLL
