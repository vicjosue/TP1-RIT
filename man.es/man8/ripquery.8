     ripquery - send a RIP request to a remote host

     ripquery [-n] host

DESCRIPTION
     The ripquery command can be used to send a RIP request to a remote host.
     If the remote host runs a RIP server it will reply to the RIP request and
     sends its current routing table entries.  ripquery will then print these
     entries. The option -n can be used to suppress the IP number to name con­
     version.
