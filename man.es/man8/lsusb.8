lsusb(8)               Linux USB Utilities               lsusb(8)



NAME
       lsusb - list all USB devices

SYNOPSIS
       lsusb [options]

DESCRIPTION
       lsusb  is  a  utility for displaying information about all
       USB buses in the system and all devices connected to them.

       To  make use of all the features of this program, you need
       to have Linux kernel 2.3.15 or newer  which  supports  the
       /proc/bus/usb interface.


OPTIONS
       -v     Tells  lsusb  to  be  verbose  and display detailed
              information about all devices.

       -vv    Tells lsusb to be very  verbose  and  display  even
              more   information  (actually  everything  the  PCI
              device is able to tell).

       -s [[<bus>]:][<devnum>]]
              Show only devices in specified bus and devnum.

       -d [<vendor>]:[<product>]
              Show only devices with specified vendor and product
              ID.  Both  ID's are given in hexadecimal and may be
              omitted.

       -p <procpath>
              Use another path instead of /proc/bus/usb.

       -D <device>
              Do not scan the  /proc/bus/usb  directory,  instead
              display only information if the device whose device
              file is given.

       -t     Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierar­
              chy as a tree.


FILES
       /usr/share/usb.ids
              A  list  of  all known USB ID's (vendors, products,
              classes, subclasses and protocols).

       /proc/bus/usb
              An  interface  to  USB  devices  provided  by   the
              post-2.3.15  Linux kernels. Contains per-bus subdi­
              rectories with per-device files and a devices  file
              containing a list of all USB devices.
