MINGETTY(8)         Linux Programmer's Manual         MINGETTY(8)



NAME
       mingetty - minimal getty for consoles

SYNOPSIS
       mingetty [--noclear] [--long-hostname] tty


DESCRIPTION
       mingetty  is  a minimal getty for use on virtual consoles.
       Unlike agetty(8), mingetty  is  not  suitable  for  serial
       lines.  I recommend using mgetty(8) for this purpose.


OPTIONS
       --noclear
              Do  not  clear  the screen before prompting for the
              login name (the screen is normally cleared).

       --long-hostname
              By default the hostname is only printed  until  the
              first dot.  With this option enabled, the full text
              from gethostname() is shown.


ISSUE ESCAPES
       mingetty recognizes the following escapes sequences  which
       might be embedded in the /etc/issue file:

       \d     insert current day (localtime),

       \l     insert line on which mingetty is running,

       \m     inserts machine architecture (uname -m),

       \n     inserts machine's network node hostname (uname -n),

       \o     inserts domain name,

       \r     inserts operating system release (uname -r),

       \t     insert current time (localtime),

       \s     inserts operating system name,

       \u     resp. \U the current number of users which are cur­
              rently  logged  in.  \U inserts "n users", where as
              \u only inserts "n".

       \v     inserts operating system version (uname -v).


EXAMPLE
       "Linux eos i386 #1 Tue Mar 19 21:54:09 MET 1996" was  pro­
       duced by putting "\s \n \m \v" into /etc/issue.


FILES
       /etc/issue, /var/run/utmp.
