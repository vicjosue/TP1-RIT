XINETD.LOG(5)                                       XINETD.LOG(5)



NAME
       xinetd.log - xinetd service log format

DESCRIPTION
       A  service  configuration  may  specify various degrees of
       logging when attempts are made to access the service. When
       logging  for  a  service  is enabled, xinetd will generate
       one-line log entries which have the following format  (all
       entries have a timestamp as a prefix):

              entry: service-id data

       The  data  depends  on  the  entry.   Possible entry types
       include:

              START       generated when a server is started

              EXIT        generated when a server exits

              FAIL        generated when it is  not  possible  to
                          start a server

              DATA        generated  when  an  attempt to start a
                          server fails and the  service  supports
                          the RECORD log option.

              USERID      generated  if  the USERID log option is
                          used.

              NOID        generated if the USERID log  option  is
                          used,  and  the  IDONLY service flag is
                          used, and the remote end does not iden­
                          tify  who  is trying to access the ser­
                          vice.

       In the following, the  information  enclosed  in  brackets
       appears if the appropriate log option is used.

       A START entry has the format:

              START: service-id [pid=%d] [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]

       An EXIT entry has the format:

              EXIT:    service-id   [type=%d]   [pid=%d]   [dura­
              tion=%d(sec)]

       type can be either status or signal.  The number is either
       the exit status or the signal that caused process termina­
       tion.

       A FAIL entry has the format:

              FAIL: service-id reason [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]

       Possible reasons are:

              fork           a certain number of consecutive fork
                             attempts  failed  (this  number is a
                             configurable parameter)

              time           the time check failed

              address        the address check failed

              service_limit  the   allowed   number   of   server
                             instances  for this service would be
                             exceeded

              process_limit  a limit on the number of forked pro­
                             cesses was specified and it would be
                             exceeded

       A DATA entry has the format:

              DATA: service-id data

       The data logged depends on the service.

              login       remote_user=%s local_user=%s tty=%s

              exec        remote_user=%s verify=status command=%s
                          Possible status values:

                          ok        the password was correct

                          failed    the password was incorrect

                          baduser   no such user

              shell       remote_user=%s local_user=%s command=%s

              finger      received string or EMPTY-LINE

       A USERID entry has the format:

              USERID: service-id text

       The text is the response of the identification  daemon  at
       the  remote  end  excluding  the  port  numbers (which are
       included in the response).

       A NOID entry has the format:

              NOID: service-id IP-address reason
