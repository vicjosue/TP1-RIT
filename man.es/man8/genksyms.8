NAME
       genksyms - generate symbol version information

SYNOPSIS
       genksyms  [-wq]  [-dD] [-V] [-k version] [-p string] [out­
       put directory]

DESCRIPTION
       Genksyms reads (on standard input) the output from "gcc -E
       source.c" and generates a file containing version informa­
       tion.

       Depending on the output format indicated by the -k option,
       the  output  will  either be written to a .ver file in the
       named output directory, or to the standard output.

       Genksyms normally looks for explicit symbol table  defini­
       tions  in  the  source file.  All definitions and declara­
       tions of typedef, struct, union and enum will be saved for
       later  expansion.  Every global symbol will also be saved,
       together with pointers that will enable a  full  expansion
       later on.

       When  a  symbol  table  is found in the source, the symbol
       will  be  expanded  to  its  full  definition,  where  all
       structs,  unions, enums and typedefs will be expanded down
       to their basic part, recursively.  This final string  will
       then be used as input to a CRC algorithm that will give an
       integer that will change as soon as any  of  the  included
       definitions changes, for this symbol.

       The version information in the kernel normally looks like:
       symbol_R12345678, where 12345678 is the hexadecimal repre­
       sentation of the CRC.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Output debugging information; repeating this option
              increases the verbosity.  Debug level  1  generates
              moderate information about the actions being taken;
              debug level 2 enables  parser  recognition  output;
              debug level 3 enables lexical analysis output.

       -D, --dump
              Dump  expanded  symbol  definitions to stderr.  For
              debugging use only.

       -h, --help
              Display a summary of options and immediately  exit.

       -k version, --kernel version
              Select  the version of the kernel for which to gen­
              erate output.  Omitting this option assumes a  ver­
              sion below 2.1.0.  Versions below 2.1.18 use check­
              sum version 1, and  produce  their  output  in  the
              directory  given  on  the  command  line.  Versions
              2.1.18 and above use checksum version 2 and produce
              their output on stdout.

       -p string, --prefix string
              Prepend  the given string to the CRCs generated for
              all symbols.  This is intended for use with,  e.g.,
              SMP kernels, wherein the modules are not compatible
              at a level below that described by the data  types.
              This  is primarily caused by inline function expan­
              sions in the module code itself.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet warnings, i.e. reverse the -w option.

       -V, --version
              Display the version of genksyms.

       -w, --warnings
              Enable warnings  due  to  unrecognized  syntax  and
              declared  but undefined structures.  These warnings
              are normally suppressed.

BUGS
       The -h option is broken; --help is fine.
       genksyms [-V | --version] should display version  informa­
       tion  and  then  exit immediately.  Instead, it prints the
       version information and behaves  as  if  no  options  were
       given.

HISTORY
       This  versioning concept is a result from discussions, not
       at least on the KERNEL-channel, with a lot of people.

       The genksyms utility was created in 1994 by  Bjorn  Ekwall
       <bj0rn@blox.se>  being  mostly inspired by Jacques Gelinas
       <jack@solucorp.ca>      and      Jeremy       Fitzhardinge
       <jeremy@suite.sw.oz.au>

       It  was  rewritten  in  1996 by Richard Henderson to use a
       proper lexer and parser.
