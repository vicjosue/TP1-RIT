CHKFONTPATH(8)            Red Hat, Inc.            CHKFONTPATH(8)



NAME
       chkfontpath  -  simple interface for adding, removing, and
       listing directories in the X font server's path


SYNOPSIS
       chkfontpath [-lqfh] [-a name of directory to add] [-r name
       of directory to remove]


DESCRIPTION
       chkfontpath  provides  a  simple method of configuring the
       directories contained in the X font server's path.  As  of
       Red  Hat  6.0, all fonts in X are served via this separate
       font server process, not through the main  X  server  pro­
       cess.   This speeds up font rendering, and also allows use
       of font servers which are not running on the local host.

       chkfontpath is mainly used by rpm in its %post and %postun
       sections to add and remove new directories to the server's
       config file at installation and  de-installation  time  of
       packages containing fonts.


       -a, --add=name of directory to add
              Add a directory to the font path.

       -r, --remove=name of directory to remove
              Remove a directory from the font path.

       -l, --list
              List all directories in the font path.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet  operation;  don't  display any output to the
              screen, even when there is an error  during  opera­
              tion.

       -f, --first
              Requires  usage of the add command; puts the speci­
              fied directory first in the font path, rather  than
              last.

       -h, --help
              Show detailed help on the command line.


       When directories are added to the path, some sanity check­
       ing is performed to make sure you are not adding a  direc­
       tory without the file fonts.dir contained in it, which the
       server needs to be able to render fonts properly.  When  a
       path  is  succesfully added or removed, the xfs process is
       restarted if it is currently running.


RETURN CODES
       chkfontpath returns 0 on success, or 1 on error.


FILES
       /etc/X11/fs/config
              Configuration file for  the  X  font  server
              (xfs).
