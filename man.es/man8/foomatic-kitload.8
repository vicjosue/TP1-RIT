FOOMATIC-KITLOAD(8)                           FOOMATIC-KITLOAD(8)



NAME
       foomatic-kitload  -  installs a data kit into the foomatic
       database.

SYNOPSIS
       foomatic-kitload [ -k kit-dir] [ -d dest-dir]...

DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-kitload installs a foomatic  data  kit  into  the
       local  data  library.  It takes a -k dirname option, where
       dirname is the toplevel directory  of  a  foomatic  driver
       "kit".   A  "kit"  is  a  selection  of  XML  source files
       arranged exactly as in the source/section  of  the  master
       database (ie, opt/driver/printer/ subdirs).

       GIMP-Print's  foomatic-generator  produces  exactly such a
       kit.

       Foomatic-kitload is moderately paranoid  about  kits:  the
       kit  must  contain at least one of printer, driver or opt;
       the kit must contain only files ending in  .xml,  the  kit
       cannot  be the local library itself, etc.  But it does not
       inspect the contents of the kit files in any way.



   Options
       -k dirname
                 dirname is the toplevel directory of a  foomatic
                 driver "kit".

       -d destdir
                 destdir  is  a  prefix to prepend to the install
                 path.  This will not normally be  required,  but
                 is  useful if installing into a temporary `stag­
                 ing area' prior to installing in the final  des­
                 tination.



EXIT STATUS
       foomatic-kitload  returns  0  on success, 255 or something
       else when an error occurs.
