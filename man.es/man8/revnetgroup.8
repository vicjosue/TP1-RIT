REVNETGROUP(8)           Reference Manual          REVNETGROUP(8)



NAME
       revnetgroup - generate reverse netgroup data

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/yp/revnetgroup [-u|-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Revnetgroup  processes  the  standard input in netgroup(5)
       format into what is called reverse netgroup form. That is,
       where  the  original  file  shows  netgroup memberships in
       terms of which members reside in a particular  group,  the
       reverse  netgroup format specifies what groups are associ­
       ated with a particular member. This information is used to
       generate  the  netgroup.byuser  and  netgroup.byhosts  NIS
       maps. These reverse netgroup maps are used to  help  speed
       up  netgroup lookups, particularly for the innetgr library
       function.

       The revnetgroup command prints its results on the standard
       output. It is usually called only by /var/yp/Makefile when
       rebuilding the NIS netgroup maps.

OPTIONS
       The revnetgroup command supports the following options:

       -u     Generate  netgroup.byuser  output;  only   username
              information  in  the original netgroup file is pro­
              cessed.

       -h     Generate  netgroup.byhost  output;  only   hostname
              information  in  the original netgroup file is pro­
              cessed.

       Note at least one of the both flags must be specified.

FILES
       /var/yp/Makefile    The  Makefile   to   build   the   NIS
                           databases
       /etc/netgroup       the  default  netgroup  database file.
                           This file is most often found only  on
                           the NIS master server
