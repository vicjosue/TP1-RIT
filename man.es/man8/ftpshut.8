NAME
       ftpshut - shut down all proftpd servers at a given time

SYNOPSIS
       ftpshut [ -l min ] [ -d min ] time [ warning-message ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  ftpshut command provides an automated shutdown proce­
       dure that a superuser can use to automagically  disconnect
       current  proftpd  connections,  and  deny new connections.
       The command creates a  control  file  as  /etc/shutmsg  to
       inform proftpd processes about an impending shutdown.

OPTIONS
       time      The  time  at  which  the  ftp  servers  will be
                 brought down.  It may be the word  `now',  indi­
                 cating  an  immediate shutdown, or a future time
                 in one of two formats:  +number  or  HHMM.   The
                 first  form  brings  the  servers down in number
                 minutes, while  the  second  form  indicates  an
                 exact time of day, using a 24-hour clock format.

       -l min    Specifies the number of minutes before  shutdown
                 that new ftp access will be disabled.  If the -l
                 option is not specified, a default of 10 minutes
                 (or immediately, if less than 10 minutes remains
                 until shutdown) is used.

       -d min    Specifies the number of minutes before  shutdown
                 that  existing  ftp  connections will be discon­
                 nected.  If the -d option is  not  specified,  a
                 default  of  5  minutes (or immediately, if less
                 than 5 minutes remains until shutdown) is  used.

       warning-message
                 Optionally  provide a message which will be sent
                 to new connections (if denied) and existing con­
                 nections  (when  disconnected).  The message can
                 contain the following magic cookies, which  will
                 be  replaced as follows before being sent to new
                 or existing connections:

                 %s  time proftpd is being shut down
                 %r  time new connections will be denied
                 %d  time current connections will be dropped
                 %C  current working directory (where applicable)
                 %L  local host name (of virtualhost name)
                 %R  remote host name
                 %T  local time (format Thu Nov 15 17:12:42 1990)
                 %U  username given at login time

CAVEATS
       Proftpd servers can only be shutdown via ftpshut if a mas­
       ter daemon is running in standalone mode.  Servers running
       in inetd mode will honor the shutdown message file created
       by  ftpshut,  however  currently  running  servers  may be
       chroot(2)ed, and unable to read the shutdown message  con­
       trol file.

       It  is  possible to set an absolute shutdown time which is
       earlier than the current  time.   If  this  is  the  case,
       proftpd  will not shutdown until the indicated time on the
       following day.
