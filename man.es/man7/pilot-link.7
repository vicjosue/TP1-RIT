PILOT-LINK(7)                                       PILOT-LINK(7)



NAME
       pilot-link  - a suite of tools for communicating with Palm
       Computing, Inc.  Palm Devices as well  as  the  Handspring
       Visor,  TRGPro,  and  other  devices which conform to this
       standard (PalmOS licensed devices).

DESCRIPTION
       The pilot-link suite of tools contains a  series  of  con­
       duits  for moving information to and from your Palm device
       and your desktop or workstation system.

TARGET DEVICE
       All of the pilot-link programs will default to  /dev/pilot
       as  the  default  serial device used to communicate with a
       Palm. In general, if the environment  variable  $PILOTPORT
       is  set,  its  value  will  override the default. A serial
       device specified on the command-line will be used  regard­
       less of any $PILOTPORT setting.

       The  default connection rate is 9600 baud. You are welcome
       to try higher baud rates (19200, 38400, 57600  or  higher)
       by  setting the $PILOTRATE environment variable, but vari­
       ous machines have various limitations. (Be  careful  about
       values  higher  than  115200 on Linux boxes if you've been
       using setserial to change the multiplier.)

USAGE
       Here is a list  of  programs  available  from  within  the
       pilot-link package as of the date of this manpage.

              lems with your serial port. Query the RAM/ROM, list

              The pilot-unix mailing list is for  discussion  and
              idea-sharing  for  those  interested  in using your
              Palm PDA with UNIX systems.  This  includes  people
              who  are  interested in helping to develop tools to
              allow the Palm to operate with UNIX,  and  possibly
              to develop an SDK for the Palm for Unix.

       For  more  information,  including how to subscribe to the
       list, send mail containing the word 'INFO' to  pilot-unix-
       request@hcirisc.cs.binghamton.edu.   The subject line does
