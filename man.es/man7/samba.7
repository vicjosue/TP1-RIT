NAME
       SAMBA - A Windows SMB/CIFS fileserver for UNIX

SYNOPSIS
       Samba

DESCRIPTION
       The  Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
       implements the Server Message Block (commonly  abbreviated
       as  SMB) protocol for UNIX systems. This protocol is some­
       times also referred to as the Common Internet File  System
       (CIFS), LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.

       smbd   The  smbd  daemon  provides the file and print ser­
              vices to SMB clients, such as Windows  95/98,  Win­
              dows  NT, Windows for Workgroups or LanManager. The
              configuration file for this daemon is described  in
              smb.conf

       nmbd   The  nmbd  daemon  provides NetBIOS nameserving and
              browsing support. The configuration file  for  this
              daemon is described in smb.conf

       smbclient
              The  smbclient program implements a simple ftp-like
              client. This is useful for accessing SMB shares  on
              other  compatible servers (such as Windows NT), and
              can also be used to allow a UNIX box to print to  a
              printer  attached  to  any SMB server (such as a PC
              running Windows NT).

       testparm
              The testparm utility is a simple syntax checker for
              Samba's smb.confconfiguration file.

       testprns
              The testprns utility supports testing printer names
              defined in your printcap> file used by Samba.

       smbstatus
              The smbstatus tool provides access  to  information
              about the current connections to smbd.

       nmblookup
              The  nmblookup tools allows NetBIOS name queries to
              be made from a UNIX host.

       make_smbcodepage
              The make_smbcodepage utility provides  a  means  of
              creating  SMB  code  page definition files for your
              smbd server.

       smbpasswd
              The smbpasswd command is a tool for changing LanMan
              and Windows NT password hashes on Samba and Windows
              NT servers.

COMPONENTS
       The Samba suite is made up  of  several  components.  Each
       component  is  described  in a separate manual page. It is
       strongly recommended that you read the documentation  that
       comes  with Samba and the manual pages of those components
       that you use. If the manual pages aren't clear enough then
       please  send  a  patch  or  bug report to  samba@samba.org
       <URL:mailto:samba@samba.org>

AVAILABILITY
       The Samba software suite is licensed under the GNU  Public
       License(GPL). A copy of that license should have come with
       the package in the file COPYING.  You  are  encouraged  to
       distribute  copies of the Samba suite, but please obey the
       terms of this license.

       The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained  via
       anonymous  ftp from samba.org in the directory pub/samba/.
       It is also available on several mirror sites worldwide.

       You may also find useful information about  Samba  on  the
       newsgroup  comp.protocol.smb <URL:news:comp.protocols.smb>
       and the Samba mailing list. Details on  how  to  join  the
       mailing  list are given in the README file that comes with
       Samba.

       If you have access to a WWW viewer (such  as  Netscape  or
       Mosaic)  then  you  will also find lots of useful informa­
       tion, including back issues of the Samba mailing list,  at
       http://lists.samba.org <URL:http://lists.samba.org/>.

VERSION
       This  man  page  is  correct  for version 2.2 of the Samba
       suite.

CONTRIBUTIONS
       If you wish to contribute to the  Samba  project,  then  I
       suggest    you    join   the   Samba   mailing   list   at
       http://lists.samba.org <URL:http://lists.samba.org/>.

       If you have patches to submit or bugs to report  then  you
       may  mail them directly to samba-patches@samba.org.  Note,
       however, that due to the enormous popularity of this pack­
       age  the Samba Team may take some time to respond to mail.
       We prefer patches in diff -u format.

CONTRIBUTORS
       Contributors to the project are now too numerous  to  men­
       tion  here  but all deserve the thanks of all Samba users.
       To      see      a      full      list,      look       at
       ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log
       <URL:ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log>  for  the
       pre-CVS             changes             and             at
       ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log
       <URL:ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log> for the con­
       tributors to Samba post-CVS. CVS is the Open Source source
       code  control  system  used  by  the Samba Team to develop
       Samba. The project would have  been  unmanageable  without
       it.

       In  addition,  several  commercial  organizations now help
       fund the Samba Team with money and equipment. For  details
       see  the Samba Web pages at  http://samba.org/samba/samba-
       thanks.html.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
