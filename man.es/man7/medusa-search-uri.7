MEDUSA-SEARCH-URI(7)                         MEDUSA-SEARCH-URI(7)



NAME
       medusa-search-uri - syntax for medusa searches

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-search:[file:///] criterion [ & criterion ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       medusa-indexd  produces file system indices which can then
       be queried with msearch or with the libmedusa libraries  .
       This manual page documents the syntax used to specify what
       to search for.

       WARNING: This  manual  page  is  mostly  cloned  from  the
       search_uri_rfc document in the medusa distribution and has
       been put into manual  page  form  by  someone  who  really
       doesn't know how it all works.  It also documents what the
       aforementioned document says works at the  moment,  rather
       than how it ought to work eventually.

   Search method and root
       Search URIs begin with a search method:

              gnome-search:

       followed by a bracketed file system root:

              [file:///]

       At  the  moment  medusa:  or search: will also be accepted
       instead of gnome-search:.  You are supposed to be able  to
       specify multiple bracketed roots, which are supposed to be
       able to have protocols other than file:, and  roots  other
       than  /,  but I believe at the moment it has to be exactly
       as above.

   Criteria
       The search method and root are followed  by  one  or  more
       criteria.   If  there is more than one, they are separated
       by ampersands:

              criterion
              criterion & criterion
              criterion & criterion & criterion
              ...

       According to the specification, vertical bars (|)  can  be
       used  to specify an or relation, and parentheses (( and ))
       can be used to group criteria, but I  believe  neither  of
       these features is currently implemented.

       Below is the list of criteria that are understood:

              file_name is string
              file_name contains string
              file_name does_not_contain string
              file_name begins_with string
              file_name matches glob-pattern
              file_name regexp_matches regexp-pattern

              directory_name is string
              directory_name contains string
              directory_name regexp_matches regexp-pattern
              directory_name does_not_regexp_match regexp-pattern

       (I think is_in means ``is a subdirectory of.''   Directory
       searches don't seem to work for me, though.)

              file_type is application
              file_type is_not application
              file_type is music
              file_type is_not music
              file_type is text_file
              file_type is_not text_file
              file_type is file
              file_type is_not file
              file_type is directory
              file_type is_not directory

              modified is MM/DD/YYYY
              modified is_not MM/DD/YYYY
              modified is_before MM/DD/YYYY
              modified is_after MM/DD/YYYY
              modified is today
              modified is yesterday
              modified is_within_a_week_of MM/DD/YYYY
              modified is_within_a_month_of MM/DD/YYYY
              mtime is_before time_t
              mtime is_after time_t

              owner is login
              owner has_uid uid
              owner is_not login
              owner does_not_have_uid uid

              group is groupname
              group has_gid gid
              group is_not groupname
              group does_not_have_gid gid

              size larger_than byte-count
              size smaller_than byte-count
              size is byte-count

              permissions_to_read include_uid uid

              content includes_all_of string
              content includes_any_of string
              content does_not_include_all_of string
              content does_not_include_any_of string

       (This  syntax  is  wrong  for  the content searches, but I
       don't know what the real syntax is, because even when I do
       a search from inside Nautilus I get the error message that
       the URI is invalid.)

              keywords include keyword
              keywords do_not_include keyword

       I leave out the other search criteria that  search_uri_rfc
       documents but says are unimplemented now.

EXAMPLES
       msearch 'gnome-search:[file:///]file_name is etc'
       msearch    'gnome-search:[file:///]file_name   begins_with
       gnome-s'
       msearch     'gnome-search:[file:///]file_name      matches
       gnome*.png'
       msearch  'gnome-search:[file:///]file_name  regexp_matches
       ^k[st]e'
       msearch 'gnome-search:[file:///]modified is 02/01/2001'
