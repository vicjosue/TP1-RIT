NAME
       groff_ms - groff ms macros

SYNOPSIS
       groff -ms [ options...  ] [ files...  ]
       groff -m ms [ options...  ] [ files...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU  version of the ms
       macros, which is part of  the  groff  document  formatting
       system.  The groff ms macros are intended to be compatible
       with the documented behaviour  of  the  4.3  BSD  Unix  ms
       macros subject to the following limitations:

       ·      the  internals  of  groff ms are not similar to the
              internals of Unix ms and so documents  that  depend
              upon implementation details of Unix ms may well not
              work with groff ms;

       ·      there is no support for typewriter-like devices;

       ·      Berkeley localisms, in particular  the  TM  and  CT
              macros, are not implemented;

       ·      groff ms does not provide cut marks;

       ·      multiple  line spacing is not allowed (use a larger
              vertical spacing instead);

       ·      groff ms does not work in  compatibility  mode  (eg
              with the -C option);

       ·      the  error-handling policy of groff ms is to detect
              and report errors, rather than silently  to  ignore
              them.

       The groff ms macros make use of many features of GNU troff
       and therefore cannot be used with any other troff.

       Bell Labs localisms are not implemented in either the  BSD
       ms macros or in the groff ms macros.

       Some  Unix ms documentation says that the CW and GW number
       registers can be used to control the column width and gut­
       ter width respectively.  This is not the case.  These num­
       ber registers are not used in groff ms.

       Macros that cause a reset set  the  indent.   Macros  that
       change  the  indent  do  not  increment  or  decrement the
       indent, but rather set  it  absolutely.   This  can  cause
       problems  for  documents  that define additional macros of
       their own.  The solution is to use not the in request  but
       instead the RS and RE macros.

       The number register GS is set to 1 by the groff ms macros,
       but is not used by the Unix ms  macros.   It  is  intended
       that  documents  that  need  to determine whether they are
       being formatted with Unix ms or groff ms make use of  this
       number register.

       Footnotes  are implemented so that they can safely be used
       within  keeps  and   displays.    Automatically   numbered
       footnotes  within  floating keeps are not recommended.  It
       is safe to have another \** between a \** and  the  corre­
       sponding  .FS;  it  is  required  only that each .FS occur
       after the corresponding \** and that  the  occurrences  of
       .FS are in the same order as the corresponding occurrences
       of \**.

       The strings \*{ and \*} can be used to  begin  and  end  a
       superscript.

       Some  Unix  V10 ms features are implemented.  The B, I and
       BI macros can have an optional third argument  which  will
       be  printed in the current font before the first argument.
       There is a macro CW like B that  changes  to  a  constant-
       width font.

       The  following strings can be redefined to adapt the groff
       ms macros to languages other than English:

       The font family is reset from the string FAM; at  initial­
       ization  if this string is undefined it is set to the cur­
       rent font family.  The point size, vertical  spacing,  and
       inter-paragraph  spacing  for footnotes are taken from the
       number registers FPS,  FVS,  and  FPD;  at  initialization
       these  are  set to \n(PS-2, \n[FPS]+2, and \n(PD/2 respec­
       tively; however,  if  any  of  these  registers  has  been
       defined  before  initialization,  it will not be set.  The
       hyphenation flags (as set by the .hy request) are set from
       the  HY register; if this has not been defined at initial­
       ization, it will be set to 14.

       Right-aligned displays are available with .DS R and .RD.

       The following conventions are used for  names  of  macros,
       strings and number registers.  External names available to
       documents that use the groff ms macros contain only upper­
       case  letters  and  digits.   Internally  the  macros  are
       divided into modules.  Names used only within  one  module
       are  of the form module*name.  Names used outside the mod­
       ule in which they are defined are of the form module@name.
       Names  associated with a particular environment are of the
       form environment:name; these are used only within the  par
       module,  and  name  does  not  have a module prefix.  Con­
       structed names used to implement arrays are  of  the  form
       array!index.  Thus the groff ms macros reserve the follow­
       ing names:

       ·      names containing *;

       ·      names containing @;

       ·      names containing :;

       ·      names containing only uppercase letters and digits.
