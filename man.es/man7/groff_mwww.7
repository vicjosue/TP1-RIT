NAME
       groff_mwww - groff macros for authoring web pages

SYNOPSIS
       groff -mwww [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page describes the GNU -mwww macros, which is
       part of the groff document formatting system.  The  manual
       page  is  very  a  basic guide, and the html device driver
       (grohtml) has been completely rewritten but still  remains
       as  in an alpha state.  It has been included into the dis­
       tribution so that a lot of people have a  chance  to  test
       it.   Note  that  this  macro  file  will be automatically
       called (via the troffrc file) if you use -Thtml.

       To see the hyperlinks in action, please  format  this  man
       page with the grohtml device.

       Here  is  a  summary  of the functions found in this macro
       set.

SYNPOSIS
       .HTMLINDEX          determine automatic link cut off
                           point for sections/headers
       .BODYCOLOR          specify colours on a web page
       .BACKGROUND         specify background image
       .URL                create a url using two parameters
       .MAILTO             create a html email address
       .FTP                create an ftp reference
       .IMAGE              include an image file
       .HTML               pass an html raw request to the
                           device driver
       .TAG                generate an html name tag from $1
       .LINE               create a full width horizontal rule

       Output of the pic, eqn, refer, and  tbl  preprocessors  is
       acceptable as input.

REQUESTS
       HTMLINDEX
              determines  the  cut  off  point for automatic link
              generation to headings.  By  default  all  headings
              found  in  a  troff  document have links created to
              them at the top of the html  web  page.   It  maybe
              that  many  of  the  lower  heading  levels  do not
              require links.  Alternatively some  web  pages  may
              not need any heading links at all, in which case:

              .HTMLINDEX 0

              will  tell  grohtml not to generate links.  An HTM­
              LINDEX of 2 will mean that a heading

              1.1.1 Some Title

              will not be included in the links either as  it  is
              said  to  have  a  heading level of three.  Another
              method for switching automatic headings is via  the
              command line switch -P-l.

       BODYCOLOR
              takes   five  parameters:  foreground,  background,
              active hypertext link, hypertext link not yet  vis­
              ited, and visited hypertext link colour.

       BACKGROUND
              the  only parameter to this macro is the background
              image file.

       URL    generates a URL using either  two  or  three  argu­
              ments.   $1  is  the  name  of  the link, $2 is the
              actual URL, and $3 is optional stuff to be  printed
              immediately  after  $2.   Hyphenation  is  disabled
              while printing the actual URL; explicit breakpoints
              should be inserted with the \: escape.  Here is how
              to encode homepage  for  groff  <http://groff.ffii.
              org/>:

              .URL "homepage for groff" http://\:groff.\:ffii.\:org/ :

              If  this is processed by a device other than -Thtml
              it appears as: homepage  for  groff  <http://groff.
              ffii.org>.   The  URL macro can be of any type; for
              example we can reference Eric Raymond's  pic  guide
              <pic.html> by:

              .URL "Eric Raymond's pic guide" pic.html


       MAILTO generates an email html reference.  The first argu­
              ment  is  mandatory  as  the  email  address.   The
              optional  second  argument  is  the text you see in
              your browser, and an  optional  third  argument  is
              stuff  printed  immediately  after the second argu­
              ment.  Hyphenation is disabled while  printing  the
              actual email address.  For example, the groff main­
              tainers are Werner  Lemberg  <wl@gnu.org>  and  Ted
              Harding  <Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk>.   This  is
              achieved by the following macros:

              .MAILTO wl@gnu.org "Werner Lemberg"
              .MAILTO Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk "Ted Harding" .

              Note that all the urls actually are treated as con­
              suming  no  textual  space in groff.  This could be
              considered as a bug since it causes some  problems.
              To  circumvent  this, www.tmac inserts a zero-width
              character which expands to a harmless  space  (only
              if run with -Thtml).

       FTP    indicates  that  data can be obtained via ftp.  The
              first argument is the browser text and  the  second
              is  the  url.   A  third  argument,  similar to the
              macros above, is intended for stuff printed immedi­
              ately  after  the  second argument.  The second and
              the third parameter are optional.   Hyphenation  is
              disabled  while  printing  the  actual  URL.  As an
              example, here the location  of  the  current  groff
              development  distribution  <ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/
              groff/devel/groff-current.tar.gz>.  The macro exam­
              ple above was specified by:

              .FTP "current groff development distribution" \
              ftp://ftp.ffii.org/\:pub/\:groff/\:devel/\:groff-current.tar.gz .


       IMAGE  allows the document to include pictures.  The first
              argument is the image file.   The  second  optional
              argument  gives the horizontal location; l puts the
              image to the left border,  r  to  the  right.   Any
              other  value centers the image.  The next two argu­
              ments are optional  also:  Argument  three  is  the
              width  in pixels (default is 400 pixels if absent).
              The  fourth  argument  is  the  height  in   pixels
              (default is the width value if absent).


       HTML   all  text  after this macro is treated as raw html.
              If the document is processed  without  -Thtml  then
              the  macro  is  ignored.   This macro is a building
              block for other higher level macros.

              For example, the BACKGROUND macro is defined as:
              .de BACKGROUND
              .   HTML <body background=\$1>
              ..


       TAG    generates an html name tag from its argument.  This
              can  then be referenced using the URL <#URL> macro.
              As you can see, you must precede the tag name  with
              `#'  since  it is a local reference.  This link was
              achieved via placing a TAG in the  URL  description
              above; the source looks like this:

              .TP
              .B URL
              generates
              .TAG URL
              a URL using either two or three
              arguments.
              $1 is the name of the link, $2 is the actual URL.


       LINE   generates a full width horizontal rule.  Example:

              .LINE


       LINKS  requests  that grohtml place the automatically gen­
              erated links at this position.  For example:

SECTION HEADING LINKS
       By default grohtml generates links to all section headings
       and  places  these  at  the top of the html document. (See
       LINKS <#LINK> for details of how to  switch  this  off  or
       alter the position.
