NAME
       plugger - a streaming multimedia plugin for UNIX netscape
       pluggerrc - configure file for plugger


DESCRIPTION
       Plugger is a  Netscape plugin which can show many types of
       multimedia inside your Netscape. To accomplish this, Plug­
       ger  uses  external  programs such as xanim, mtv, timidity
       and tracker.

       For up-to-date information on  Plugger,  see  the  plugger
       home page: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger.html



CONFIGURE FILE
       You  can  configure plugger by changing the file pluggerrc
       which can be located in any of the following directories:

            $HOME/.netscape/
            $HOME/.opera/
            $MOZILLA_HOME/
            $OPERA_HOME/
            /usr/local/netscape/pluggerrc
            /etc/pluggerrc
            /usr//etc/pluggerrc
            /usr/local/etc/pluggerrc


       The format of pluggerrc is very simple. The general layout
       is  to  have  one or more lines describing mime-types fol­
       lowed by one or more lines  describing  commands  used  to
       handle  those  mime-types. Lines beginning with # are con­
       sidered comments and are ignored. Here is a  simple  exam­
       ple:

            video/mpeg; mpeg; Mpeg video
            video/quicktime; qt; Mpeg video
                 : xanim +W$window -Zr +q +Ze +f $file

            audio/mpeg2: mp2: MPEG audio
            audio/x-mpeg2: mp2: MPEG audio
            audio/mpeg3: mp3: MPEG audio
            audio/x-mpeg3: mp3: MPEG audio
            audio/mpeg: mpa,abs,mpega: MPEG audio
            audio/x-mpeg: mpa,abs,mpega: MPEG audio
                 stream, preload: mpg123 -q -b 128 -
                 many: splay -t 200 $file
                 many: amp -b 200 -q $file


       Each line describing a mime type has three fields:

             mime type ; extensions ; description


       mime type
              The mime type is the standardized name for the con­
              tent type you want Plugger to handle. This must  be
              the  same type as the web server claims the file to
              be, or Plugger will not  be  used  for  that  file,
              regardless of the extension.

       extensions
              This  is  a comma separated list of extensions that
              should be  associated  with  this  particular  mime
              type.  The  extensions  are  only  used  when a web
              server does not report what type of file it is,  or
              when loading files directly from disk.

       description
              This is the description that shows up in about:plu­
              gins and in the application preferences section  in
              Netscape.


              Lines  that describe what command to use for a mime
              type must begin with  a  whitespace  and  have  two
              fields:

                    flags : command


       flags  This is a comma-separated list of flags which tells
              plugger how to handle this particular  application.
              See below for further details.

       command
              This  is  a  command  which is sent to /bin/sh when
              handling this mime type.



FINDING THE RIGHT COMMAND
       When Plugger is called from netscape, it looks through the
       configuration file and tries to find a matching mime type.
       For an application to be chosen it has to fulfill  certain
       criteria,  it  has  to  exist, and it must match the flags
       given to plugger.

       When it does, it tries to figure out which command to use.
       If  the input is streamable, it looks through all the com­
       mands for that particular mime type to see if it can  find
       an application that has the stream flag. If it cannot find
       a streaming application it downloads the  file  and  tries
       again.  Note that Plugger will check the first word of the
       command and search your $PATH for that  command.  If  that
       command  is  not found Plugger will go to the next line in
       your pluggerrc.


FLAGS
       repeat This indicates that the command  uses  the  $repeat
              variable.  If  this  flag is set, Plugger will only
              start the application once.

       loop   This indicates that the application loops  forever.
              If  the <EMBED> tag used to start Plugger indicated
              that the file should not loop forever, the  command
              on this line will not be used.

       stream This  indicates  that  this  command takes input on
              stdin.  Plugger will attempt to stream data  as  it
              is being downloaded and send it to the application.
              Note that streaming applications can also  be  used
              to  play  files  and  data which is already in your
              netscape cache.

       preload
              This flag is only meaningful in when used  together
              with the stream flag. It tells plugger to preload a
              buffer with 40000 bytes of data before starting  to
              play the file. If the buffer runs out, Plugger will
              stop sending data  to  the  application  until  the
              buffer  is full again. This is usually a good thing
              for streaming sound.

       many   This indicates that the application can accept sev­
              eral  files  on the command line. Using this option
              can reduce clicks, choppiness and machine load, but
              it is never required.

       ignore_errors
              This  options tells Plugger to ignore the exit sta­
              tus of the application.

       exits  This option  tells  Plugger  that  the  application
              exits,  but  should  not  be restarted. This can be
              used with applications  which  automatically  forks
              into the background.

       nokill This  will  tell  plugger  not  to  try to kill the
              application when leaving the page. This is normally
              used  for  programs which start in their own window
              and can play multiple files, such as xmms.

       swallow ( name )
              This is the only option that takes an  argument  so
              far. It will tell plugger that the application will
              open a window with the specified name and that this
              window will then be moved to inside your browser.


VARIABLES
       Plugger  gives some variables to /bin/sh when starting the
       application, these variables are:


       $repeat
              This variable contains  how  many  times  the  file
              should  be  played.   Applications  which  use this
              variable should also set the repeat flag.

       $window
              This is the X window Netscape has given the plugin.
              This can be used with applications such as xanim to
              display graphics inside the netscape window.

       $file  This is the file to play. This variable is not  set
              if  the  application  uses  the stream flag. It may
              also be more than one file  if  you  use  the  many
              flag.

       $mimetype
              This variable contains the mime type of $file.


BUGS
       You  have to remove ~/.netscape/plugin-list after changing
       the configuration, or  nothing  will  happen.  This  is  a
       netscape bug, not a Plugger bug.

       Netscape  3.x  will not play anything for <EMBED> tags for
       which height or width are zero. This  too  is  a  Netscape
       bug.
