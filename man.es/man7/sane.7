NAME
       sane - Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing scanners


DESCRIPTION
       SANE is an application programming  interface  (API)  that
       provides  standardized  access to any raster image scanner
       hardware. The standardized interface makes it possible  to
       write  just  one driver for each scanner device instead of
       one driver for each scanner and application.

       While SANE is primarily targeted at  a  UNIX  environment,
       the standard has been carefully designed to make it possi­
       ble to implement the API  on  virtually  any  hardware  or
       operating system.

       This  manual  page  provides  a summary of the information
       available about SANE.


TERMINOLOGY
       An application that uses the SANE interface  is  called  a
       SANE  frontend.   A driver that implements the SANE inter­
       face is called a SANE backend.  A  meta  backend  provides
       some means to manage one or more other backends.


SANE STANDARD AND WRITING BACKENDS
       The  SANE  standard  defines  the  application programming
       interface (API) that is used to communicate between  fron­
       tends    and    backends.    It    can    be    found   at
       /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/sane.ps (if latex is installed on your
       system)       and      on      the      SANE      website:
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/html/        (HTML),        or
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane.ps (Postscript).

       There   is   some  more  information  for  programmers  in
       /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/backend-writing.txt.   Some   of   the
       internal  SANE routines (sanei) are documented using doxy­
       gen: http://sanei.meier-geinitz.de/ . Before a new backend
       or   frontend   project   is   started,  have  a  look  at
       /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/PROJECTS for projects that are planned
       or not yet included into the SANE distribution.

       Your    help    is    always    appreciated.    Look    at
       /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/TODO for things that should  be  done.
       Not only programmers are needed, but also reading and fix­
       ing the documentation and reporting bugs  would  be  nice.
       Further  more,  translations  of  the  backend options are
       needed. Contact the SANE mailing list for details.


SOFTWARE PACKAGES
       The package `sane-backends' contains a  lot  of  backends,
       documentation  (including  the  SANE standard), networking
       support, and the command line frontend  `scanimage'.   The
       frontends `xscanimage', `xcam', and `scanadf' are included
       in the package `sane-frontends'.   Both  packages  can  be
       downloaded        from       the       SANE       homepage
       (http://www.mostang.com/sane/).  Information  about  other
       frontends  and  backends can be found on the frontend page
       (http://www.mostang.com/sane/frontends.html).


GENERAL INFORMATION
       The following  sections  provide  short  descriptions  and
       links  to  more information about several aspects of SANE.
       A name with a number in parenthesis  (e.g.  `sane-dll(5)')
       points  to  a  manual page, in this case `man 5 sane-dll'.
       Entries like `/usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/sane.tex' are references
       to  text  files that were copied to the SANE documentation
       directory   (/usr/doc/sane-1.0.7)   during   installation.
       Everything else is an URL to a resource on the web.


       SANE homepage
         Information  on all aspects of SANE including a tutorial
         and a link to the SANE FAQ can  be  found  on  the  SANE
         homepage: http://www.mostang.com/sane/.

       SANE mailing list
         There  is  a  mailing list for the purpose of discussing
         the SANE standard and its  implementations:  sane-devel.
         Since this is currently the only mailing list devoted to
         SANE, it's perfectly OK to ask questions  that  are  not
         strictly  related  to SANE development. How to subscribe
         and unsubscribe: http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html

       Compiling and installing SANE
         Look at /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/README and the  os-dependent
         README   files   for  information  about  compiling  and
         installing SANE.

       SCSI configuration
         For information about  various  systems  and  SCSI  con­
         trollers see sane-scsi(5).  USB configuration For infor­
         mation about USB configuration see sane-usb(5).

MISCELLANEOUS BACKENDS
       sane-dll
         The sane-dll library implements a SANE backend that pro­
         vides access to an arbitrary number of other SANE  back­
         ends by dynamic loading. See sane-dll(5).

       sane-net
         The  SANE  network daemon saned provides access to scan­
         ners located on different computers in  connection  with
         the net backend. See sane-net(5) and saned(1).

       sane-pnm
         PNM  image  reader  pseudo-backend.  The purpose of this
         backend is primarily to aid in debugging of  SANE  fron­
         tends. See sane-pnm(5).

       sane-pint
         Backend  for  scanners  that  use  the PINT (Pint Is Not
         Twain) device driver.  The PINT driver is being actively
         developed  on  the OpenBSD platform, and has been ported
         to a few other *nix-like operating  systems.  See  sane-
         pint(5),

       sane-v4l
         The sane-v4l library implements a SANE backend that pro­
         vides generic access to video cameras and similar equip­
         ment  using  the  V4L  (Video  for Linux) API. See sane-
         v4l(5).

       Also, have a look  at  the  backend  information  page  at
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html   and   the
       list of projects in /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/PROJECTS.


PROBLEMS
       Please note that the default configuration  uses  sane-dll
       as  the  top-level  backend.   Hence it is probably a good
       idea to start with  reading  sane-dll(5).   The  top-level
       backend   is  determined  by  the  libsane.*  symlinks  in
       /usr/lib/sane.

       For SCSI scanners reading of sane-scsi(5) is  recommended.
       For USB scanners, sane-usb(5) may help.

       If  you encounter any problems with getting your device(s)
       recognized, try setting the various environment  variables
       that  are  available to assist in debugging such problems.
       The environment variables are documented in  the  relevant
       manual  pages.   For example, to get the maximum amount of
       debug information when testing a Mustek SCSI scanner,  set
       environment  variables  SANE_DEBUG_DLL, SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK,
       and SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 and then invoke scanimage
       or  whatever program you're trying to debug.  For a Mustek
       scanner at /dev/scanner, you might want to invoke  scanim­
       age as follows:

              scanimage -d mustek:/dev/scanner -h

       If this works, you could try to acquire an image with:

              scanimage -d mustek:/dev/scanner >t.pnm

       If  you  are not sure what generic SCSI or USB device your
       scanner is connected to, try the  command  sane-find-scan­
       ner.  Usually, It's sufficient to invoke the program with­
       out any arguments.  Invoking this command  should  produce
       output similar to this:

              $ sane-find-scanner

              sane-find-scanner: found "MUSTEK MFC-06000CZ 1.01"
              at device /dev/scanner
              sane-find-scanner: found "MUSTEK MFC-06000CZ 1.01"
              at device /dev/sge

       Note  that sane-find-scanner will find any scanner that is
       connected to a SCSI bus.  It will even find scanners  that
       are not supported at all by SANE.

       There  may  be  several  causes for the following messages
       from the frontends: "scanimage: no SANE devices found"  or
       "xscanimage: no devices available.".

       * Your scanner is not recognized by any backend. It is not
         supported. You may ask the maintainer  of  your  backend
         (see  /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/AUTHORS)  or  the SANE mailing
         list (see above) if support is planned.

       * SANE can't access the device files (e.g /dev/sga). Check
         the permissions.

       * Your  backend  is not listed in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf (or
         commented out).

       * There are older installations of SANE on your system. If
         you  installed  the  SANE  libraries  in  /usr/local/lib
         (default) you should  check  if  there  are  older  SANE
         libraries  at /usr/lib. Remove them (rm -r /usr/lib/lib­
         sane* /usr/lib/sane).

       * If you can use SANE with scanimage but  not  with  other
         (graphical)  frontends,  check that /etc/ld.so.conf con­
         tains    /usr/local/lib    and    does    not    contain
         /usr/local/lib/sane.  See  also the documentation of the
         frontends.


REPORTING BUGS
       If you think you found a bug in  a  backend,  contact  the
       author  of  your backend. Usually the email address can be
       found in the /usr/doc/sane-1.0.7/AUTHORS file. If he isn't
       marked  as  `active  maintainer'  you can also contact the
       SANE       mailing       list       sane-devel        (see
       http://www.mostang.com/sane/mail.html  for  details).  You
       must be subscribed to the list, otherwise your mail  won't
       be sent to the subscribers.

       If you want to report bugs concerning compilation, instal­
       lation, porting, and documentation of SANE, you  can  also
       contact  the  author  of this manual page: <henning@meier-
       geinitz.de>.
